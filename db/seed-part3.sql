5. Social Security  Numbers 
Unless otherwise required by state or federal law, 
CC 
§ 1798.89 prohibits submitting to a county recorder 
any document that is required by law to be open to 
the public if the document displays more than the last 
four digits of a social security number. 
B. PROPERTY SUBJECT TO THE LIEN  
1. Lien  Attaches  to  All Real  Property  Interests 
A   lien   on   real   property   created   pursuant   to   a   
judgment  or  order  for  support  attaches  to  all  real  
property interests of the obligor in the county where 
the lien is recorded. But, the lien will not reach rental 
payments,  a  leasehold  on  estate  with  an  unexpired  
term of less than 2 years, the interest of a beneficiary 
under  a  trust,  or  real  property  that  is  subject  to  an  
attachment   lien   in   favor   of   a   creditor   and   was   
transferred before judgment. (
CCP § 697.340(a)). 
2. Subsequently  Acquired  Property 
If  an  obligor  subsequently  acquires  any  interest  in  
real property in the county after the real property lien 
is  recorded,  the  real  property  lien  will  attach  to  the  
obligor’s   interest   in   the   subsequently   acquired   
property   at   the   time   of   acquisition.   (
CCP   §   
697.340(b)). 
C. AMOUNT OF LIEN  
1. Lien  Amount  is  Amount  Required  to  Satisfy 
the Judgment 
A lien on real property created pursuant to a support 
judgment  or  order  is  for  the  amount  of  matured  
installments,   plus   any   accrued   interest,   less   the   
amount  of  any  sums  paid  toward  the  judgment  or  
order. The real property lien does not become a lien 
for any installment until it becomes due and payable 
under  the  terms  of  the  judgment  or  order.  (

697.350(c)

2. Lien  Extends  to   Modifications 
Where  a  money  judgment  lien  on  real  property  has  
been  created  by  recording  an  abstract  of  support  
judgment  payable  in  installments,  and  the  support  
order  subsequently  either  increases  or  decreases  in  
amount, the lien extends to the judgment or order as 
modified without  having  to  record  another  abstract  
of  support  judgment.  (
CCP  §  697.360(b)  and  (d)) 
However,    if    the    support    order    subsequently    
increases   in   amount,   priority   for   any   additional   
amount under the judgment dates from the time the 
modification is effective. (
CCP § 697.360(d). 
D. DURATION OF LIEN AND EFFECT OF TRANSFER 
 
1. Duration  
A judgment or order for support, reimbursement, or 
other    arrears,    including    accrued    interest    and    
penalties,  is  enforceable  until  paid  in  full.  Support  
judgments  are  exempt  from  renewal  requirements.  
(
FC § 291 and FC §   4502). The lien on real property 
will therefore be in effect until all support obligations 
arising under the judgment or order are paid in full 
or otherwise satisfied. (
CCP § 697.320(b)). 
2. Laches  Against  the  State 
A  defense  of  laches  may  be  asserted,  and  the  court  
may consider, only against any portion of the support 
judgment owed to the state. (
FC § 291(d)). 
3. Transfer or  Encumbrance 
If the obligor’s interest in real property that is subject 
to  a  real  property  lien  is  transferred  or  encumbered  
without  satisfying  or  extinguishing  the  lien  (i.e.,  
when  the  obligor  ‘quitclaims’  his/her  interest  in  the  
real  property),  the  real  property  interest  transferred  
or  encumbered  remains  subject  to  the  lien  in  the  
amount  of  the  lien  at  the  time  the  real  property  
interest
 is transferred or encumbered, plus any',

interest subsequently accruing on the amount owing 
at  the  time  of  the  transfer.  (
CCP  §  697.390(a)  and  
(b)).  However,  the  amount  of  the  lien  does  not  
include any installments that mature after the date of 
transfer    or    encumbrance,    or    any    interest    on    
unmatured   installments.   (Guess   v.   Bernhardson   
(2015)  242  Cal.App.4
th
  820 [the  amount  of  ex-wife’s 
support judgment lien was zero because at the time 
of   the ex-husband’s encumbrance on the property he 
did not owe any unpaid and due support payments]). 
 
 PRACTICE POINT: You may learn, after the fact, of 
a  sale  of  real  property  that  did  not  address  a  valid  real  
property  lien  for  child  support.  The  LCSA  does  not  
appear  to  have  standing  to  file  an  independent  right  of  
action  against  the  title  insurance  company  or  escrow  
company.  However,  the  new  property  owner  has  those  
rights,  so  it  may  be  useful  to  make  formal  contact  with  
the   new   property   owner   and   make   the   unpleasant   
disclosure  that  the  real  property  lien  for  child  support  
remains  with  the  property.  While  the  LCSA  cannot  give  
legal  advice,  encouraging  the  new  owner  to  contact  the  
title  insurance  company  and/or  escrow  company  may  
assist  in  resolution of  the  child  support  lien. 
4. Joint  Tenancy/Rights  of  Survivorship 
If the obligor holds title to his or her interest in real 
property as a joint tenant, or as community property 
with    rights    of    survivorship,    and    the    obligor    
subsequently     dies,     the     obligor’s     interest     is     
extinguished  and  any  encumbrances  upon  him/her  
are  unenforceable.  The  title  or  interest  in  the  real  
property  passes  to  the  surviving  tenant(s)  free  and  
clear from any encumbrance previously created from 
the recorded real property lien, unless the judgment 
lien was attached prior to the creation of the right of 
survivorship.  (Tenhet  v.  Boswell  (1976)  18  Cal.3d

The   priority   in   which   competing   real   property   
judgment  liens  are  paid  is  determined  by 
CCP  § 
697.380. Generally, priorities depend upon the type 
of lien and when each lien was created.
 
2. Deeds of Trust 
Generally, the first-recorded lien on real property has 
priority  over  subsequently  recorded  liens.  (CC  §  
1214
). However, a lender who finances the purchase 
of  property  and  records  a  deed  of  trust  has  priority  
over previously recorded liens for child support. (
CC 
§    2898
;    Walley    v.    PMC    Inv.    Co.  (1968)    262 
Cal.App.2d 218, 220). 
3. Tax Liens 
Certain  tax  liens  will  have  statutory  priority  over  
support  liens  (e.g.,  
Revenue  & Taxation  Code  §  
2192.1), while the priority of some tax liens depends 
upon the time of recording and notice (e.g., 
26 USC 
§   6323). 
4. Subordination 
A   judgment   creditor   (including   the   LCSA)   may   
subordinate  (assign  a  lower  priority)  a  support  lien  
to another lien encumbrance, claim, or interest on all 
or  a  part  of  the  real  property  subject  to  the  support  
lien. (
CCP § 697.370(a)(2)). 
 PRACTICE  POINT: Subordination  of  a  support  lien  
may  occur  when  the  obligor  is  refinancing  a  mortgage  
and  the  new  lender  requires  priority  of  the  refinanced  
loan  over   the  existing  support  lien.  Typically,  a  LCSA 
will  only  subordinate the  support  lien  when the  obligor 
is  not  receiving any  monies  upon the close  of  escrow. 
If an obligor  is  taking out  equity,  or  other  loans  are 
being paid  through the refinancing,  subordination of 
the  support  lien  is  generally  not  allowed  by  the  LCSA  
without   some   monies   being   applied   to   the   support 
obligation.   There   is   no   Judicial   Council   Form   for   
subordination   of   a   lien.   If   the   LCSA   agrees   to 
subordinate its     lien,   normally   an escrow   or   title 
company  will  draft  the  subordination  agreement,  which  
should be carefully  reviewed by  the LCSA  attorney. 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Even  in  a  short  sale  when  there 
is purportedly no equity, always ask the escrow',

company for the breakdown of costs. If there are any 
commissions to be paid out, consider requesting that 
something be paid on the lien from the commission(s). 
 
F. SATISFACTION OF JUDGMENT LIENS  
1. Acknowledgment  of  Satisfaction  of  Judgment  
(JCF EJ-100) 
If an obligor’s support obligation has been satisfied, 
the   LCSA   is   required   to   immediately   file   an   
acknowledgement  of  satisfaction  of  judgment.  This  
does not apply if the satisfaction in full was obtained 
by writ. (
CCP § 724.030 and CCP § 724.040). 
2. Obligor’s  Demand 
If the money judgment has been satisfied, the LCSA 
must    file    and    serve    an    acknowledgement    of    
satisfaction of judgment within 15 days of a written 
demand from the obligor. (
CCP § 724.050). 
3. Title  or  Escrow  Company’s  Demand 
Additionally,  the  LCSA  is  required  to  respond  in  a  
timely manner to a   title or escrow company’s request 
for  a  demand  made  pursuant  to  a  recorded  real  
property lien. (
CCP § 697.360(e)). 
4. Full Satisfaction 
A full satisfaction of   judgment is filed when there are 
no  arrears  and  there  is  no  ongoing  child  support  
owed. (
CCP § 724.040). 
5. Matured  Installment 
A  matured  installment  satisfaction  of  judgment  is  
filed when all installments due and owing, plus any 
accrued  interest  and  costs  have  been  paid  through  
the date specified on the satisfaction. (
CCP §   724.210 
and CCP § 724.220). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Prior  to  executing  the  matured  
installment acknowledgment of satisfaction of 
judgment,  extra care should be  taken to  ensure that 
the accounts  are set  up properly,  and  the  accounting 
is accurate and up-to-date.',

6. Partial Satisfaction  of  Judgment 
A  partial  satisfaction  of  judgment  must  specifically  
state    the    dollar    amount    received    in    partial    
satisfaction  of  the  judgment.  (
CCP  §§    724.110  and  
724.120
). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  The  LCSA  will  execute  a  partial  
satisfaction  of  judgment  when  all  support  arrears  have  
been  paid  in  full  and  there  is  no  order  for  current 
support,  but  not  all  the  children  subject  to  the  support  
order have emancipated. 
G. RELEASE OF JUDGMENT LIEN  
1. Release of  Judgment  Lien  (DCSS  0240) 
This  form  is  used  by  the  LCSA  to  extinguish  a  lien. 
This   form   signifies   that   the   LCSA   is   no   longer   
claiming an interest in the real property of   the obligor 
in the county where the release is recorded. (
CCP § 
697.370(a)(1)). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Recording  a  release  does  not  
affect  the  amount  of  support  owed  by  the  obligor,  nor  
does  it  prevent  the  LCSA  from  subsequently  creating  
another  real  property  lien  in  the  same  county  where  the  
previous lien was extinguished. 
2. Types of Releases 
a. Property Specific Release 
Extinguishes a lien created on a particular parcel 
of  real  property.  A  specific  release  is  commonly  
used where the support obligor seeks to refinance 
or sell real property that has little or no equity. 
b. General Release 
Extinguishes a lien created on all property owned 
by  a  person  in  the  county  where  the  lien  was  
created.  A  general  release  is  commonly  used  in  
cases of mistaken identity or upon case closure.

liens on real property owned by the obligor in states 
outside   of   California.   (
CCP  §  697.320(a)).   The   
Notice of Lien requires the specific legal description 
of   the property on which the lien is to be placed and 
must    be    recorded    in    the    specific    county    or    
jurisdiction where the property is located. (See OMB 
0970-0152 current as of 2021, expires 04/30/2027).

the obligor  owns  an interest  in  real  property,  rather 
than through the Central  Registry  or  Title  IV-D  Office 
of  the other  state. The procedures  of  the state where 
the  real  property  of  the  obligor  is  located  determine 
which   office   or   department   in   that   state   is   the 
appropriate  one  to  receive  the  lien  for  recording.  The  
LCSA  issuing  the Notice  of  Lien  has  the  responsibility

X. WORKERS’  COMPENSATION  
COVID-19 IMPACT ON WCAB HEARINGS UPDATE 
In   response   to   COVID-19   the   Division   of   Workers’   
Compensation  (DWC),  issued  a  series  of  new  rules  for  
WCAB Court operations. 
Effective  03/21/2022  and  at  the  time  of  this  revision,  in- 
person  hearings  resumed  at  all  DWC  district  offices,  
except  Eureka.  In-person  hearings  will  consist  of  trials,  
lien  trials,  expedited  hearings  and  special  adjudication  
unit  (SAU)  trials  only.  Until  further  notice,  DWC  will  
continue to telephonically hear all mandatory settlement 
conferences,   priority   conferences,   status   conferences, 
SAU    conferences,    and    lien    conferences    on    the    
individually assigned judges’ conference lines. 
As  a  result  of  COVID-19  impact,  the  Eureka  District  
Office is  permanently operating online as a virtual office 
as  of  July  1,  2021.  Please  check  the  DWC  website  at

“WCAB RULES” EFFECTIVE 01/01/2020 AND 
SUBSEQUENT 01/01/2022 UPDATE 
The  WCAB  Rules  of  Practice  and  Procedure  (“WCAB  
Rules”),  as  set  forth  under  Title  8,  California  Code  of  
Regulations   (CCR)   sections   10300   –   10995,   effective   
01/01/2020,  represents  the  latest  major  changes  in  how  
LCSAs  file,  appear  and  collect  child  support  liens  in  
WCAB cases. 
To name a few of the important changes, LCSAs, as lien 
claimants,  now  have  new  status  as  “parties”  to  the  
workers’  compensation  action  from  the  outset  of  lien  
filing  (8  CCR  §  10305  (O)).  In-person  appearance  by  an  
LCSA for lien balances over $25,000 is no longer required 
at    case-in-chief    Mandatory    Settlement    Conferences    
(MSCs) and Trials. Instead LCSAs must be available for 
MSCs and Trials by telephone with settlement authority 
or    face  sanctions  (8
 CCR § 10752)  and/or  dismissal of',

liens if they fail to act promptly in certain circumstances 
(8
 CCR § 10888).  These new rules represent only some 
of the most significant changes impacting child support 
liens since LCSAs were first established in 2000. 
Since   the   last   edition   of   the   Sourcebook,   the   new   
01/01/2022 Final Rules were adopted. Given the COVID- 
19 impact on Court hearings, the primary purpose of the 
rulemaking  is  to  formalize  the  processes  for  remote  
hearings,  electronic  filing,  and  electronic  service  that  
developed  during  the  novel  coronavirus  pandemic.  To  
this  end,  WCAB  adopted  several  new  rules  to  create  
processes for noticing and objecting to remote hearings, 
remote appearances, and remote witness testimony. 
 
The     Board     also     adopted     new     definitions     for     
“Appearance,”    “Hearing,”    and    “Testimony,”    and    
revised existing rules regarding appearances to facilitate 
these  processes.  Also  added  are  new  definitions  for  
“Electronic,”    “Filing,”    and    “Service,”    and    revised    
existing rules regarding filing and service, to provide for 
expanded electronic filing and service. 
 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Given  that  LCSAs  are  now  a  
“party”  under  the  new  Rule  from  the  outset  of  lien  filing  
and  Notice  of  Hearings  are  served  on  LCSAs  at  the  
official   address   of   record   on   EAMS,   no   special   
consideration is likely given for the LCSA’s 
unavailability  by  telephone  to  resolve  child  support  lien 
at  the  MSC.  Therefore,  liens  are  subject  to  dismissal  
pursuant to 8 CCR § 10888. 
 
A. INTRODUCTION TO THE WCAB SYSTEM  
The  California  Department  of  Industrial  Relations,  
Division  of  Workers’  Compensation  (DWC),  is  the  
state  agency  that  monitors  the  administration  of  
workers''     compensation     claims     and     provides     
administrative   and   judicial   services   to   assist   in   
resolving   disputes   that   arise   in   connection   with   
claims for workers'' compensation benefits.',

DWC''s mission is to minimize the adverse impact of 
work-related  injuries  on  California  employees  and  
employers.  The  Workers’  Compensation  Appeals  
Board (WCAB) serves as the quasi-judicial branch of 
the  DWC.  The  Board  exercises  all  judicial  powers  
vested by the Labor Code in a reasonable and sound 
manner and provides guidance and leadership to the 
workers''   compensation   community   through   case   
opinions and regulations. 
The  WCAB,  located  in  San  Francisco,  consists  of  
seven-member   Commissioners   appointed   by   the   
Governor,  and  confirmed  by  the  Senate.  There  are  
over     200     trial-level     Workers’     Compensation     
Administrative Law Judges (WCJs) assigned at the 22 
District Offices and satellites locations. 
For  LCSAs,  workers’  compensation  benefits  offer  a  
lucrative    opportunity    to    collect    child    support    
payments  from  Temporary  Disability  Benefits  (TD)  
pursuant   to   
CCP   §   704.160   (b)   via   Income   
Withholding Orders (
FC § 5246) at the outset of the 
action. 
Furthermore,  child  support  payments  may  also  be  
collected by way of a child support lien pursuant to 
Labor Code § 4903 (e), deducted from Permanent 
Disability  benefits  (PD),  when  the  action  concludes  
by settlement or trial. 
The   WCAB   administrative   system   is   a   benefit   
delivery  system  intended  to  be  simple  and  less  
litigious. If a party or   lien claimant disagrees with the 
decisions  of  a  WCJ,  the  aggrieved  party  may  file  a  
Petition for Reconsideration (
LC § 5900). On Recon, 
the  case  is  removed  from  the  WCJ  trial-level  and  
assigned  to  a  three-member  panel  of  the  WCAB  in  
San Francisco. 
Decisions of   this three-member panel offer directions 
to  WCJs  on  individual  cases  and  are  not  binding.  
However,  an  en-banc  (seven-member)  decision  is  
binding precedent on all WCAB panels and WCJs.',

Decisions of the WCAB are subject to Judicial Review.  A 
party aggrieved by a final decision of the Appeals Board 
may apply to the court of   appeal for the appellate district 
in which the party resides for a   writ of   review pursuant to 
LC § 5950. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Attorneys  representing  injured  
workers   are   commonly   referred   to   as   “Applicants’   
Attorneys”  who  traditionally  receive  a  maximum  of  15%  
of   their   clients’   gross   settlements.   Accordingly,   the 
pace  of  WCAB  actions  is  fast-moving.  Settlement  of  an  
action  can  occur  at  any  time,  and  LCSAs  SHALL be 
ready   during   business   hours   to   provide   accurate   
information    on    lien    balances    and    have    available    
employees  with  settlement  authority.   The  general  rule 
is: MAKE IT EASY TO GET PAID! 
 
PLEASE  TAKE  NOTICE: Under  8 CCR § 10752 (d) 
(effective  01/01/2020),  LCSAs  SHALL  be  immediately  
available by   telephone with   full settlement   authority 
and  shall  notify  defendants  of  the  telephone  number  at  
which   the   defendants   may   reach   the   lien   claimant.   
Failure to  comply  may  give  rise  to  sanctions  under 
LC § 5813 and 8 CCR § 10421. 
 
B. TERMINOLOGY  
Workers’  Compensation  practice  involves  specialized  
medical-legal     phrases,     jargon,     descriptions,     and     
acronyms   which   can   be   confusing.   Some   common   
terminologies  are:  Primary  Treating  Physician  (PTP),  
Secondary  Treating  Physician  (STP),  Qualified  Medical  
Examiner  (QME),  Agreed  Medical  Examiner  (AME),  
Permanent   and   Stationary   or   “P&S”   and   Maximum   
Medical Improvement or “MMI”.

Generally,  if  liability  is  accepted  by  a  defendant,  an  
injured worker may be entitled to various statutory types 
of    benefits    including:    1)    medical    treatments,    2)    
temporary disability indemnity, 3) permanent disability 
indemnity,  4)  supplemental  job  displacement  voucher,  
and/or 5) death benefits payable to the injured worker’s 
dependents. 
For  LCSA  workers’  compensation  collection  purposes,  
there are two general types of benefits from which child 
support can be collected: 
1. Temporary  Disability  (TD) 
Temporary  Disability  benefits  are  intended  to  be  a  
wage-replacement  indemnity.  To  qualify  for  TD,  an  
injured worker must prove: 1) he or she has a medical 
disability that precludes him or her from working; (2) 
the    disability    must    be    temporary,    rather    than    
permanent in nature; (3) the disability must be a  result 
of  a  compensable  industrial  injury;  (4)  the  employee  
must  sustain  a  wage  loss;  and  (5)  the  wage  loss  must  
result from the work-related disability. See 
LC § 4653 
et. seq. 
If  eligible,  TD  payment  is  “two-thirds  of  the  average  
weekly  earnings  (AWE)  during  the  period  of  such  
disability” (
LC § 4653), payable every two weeks (bi- 
weekly) for up to 104 weeks, within five years from the 
date   of   injury   and   continuing   until   the   injured   
employee can return to work (regular work duties, or 
modified  work  duties),  or  becomes  “Permanent  and  
Stationary”   (“P   &   S”),   aka   “Maximum   Medical   
Improvement (“MMI”), in which the medical condition 
is static. (
LC § 4650 and LC § 4656). 
2. Permanent  Disability  (PD) 
Permanent  Disability  is  an  indemnity  benefit  paid  to  
compensate  the  injured  employee  for  future  loss  of  
earnings due to the injury, based upon such factors as 
“the   nature   of   the   injury   or   disfigurement,   the   
occupation of the injured employee, and his or her age 
at the time of the injury, consideration being given to',

an  employee’s  diminished  future  earning  capacity.” 
LC § 4660 (a). 
With  the  exceptions  of  statutorily  required  advanced  
payments,  PD  is  generally  paid  after the  settlement  is  
reached or a Findings and Award (“F&A”) after trial. 
LC § 4660 and LC § 4660.1. The levels of PD are first 
determined   by   qualified-physician(s)    assigning    a    
whole-person-impairment  (WPI)  to  the  affected  body  
part(s)  or  condition(s),  then  adjustments  are  made  
based  on  statutory  factors  (i.e.,  adjustments  for  age,  
occupation, etc.) and ultimately “rated” on a scale from 
1 to 100% disability. 
EX: Left leg amputation: 17.01.02.02 – 35 – [5]45 –   351G 
– 48 – 44 PD 
Left knee motion: 17.05.04.00 – 14 [2]16 –   351G –   18 –   16 
PD 
44% PD c 16% PD =   53% Permanent Disability 
A PD percentage chart issued by the State of   California 
is then referenced to show what compensation should 
be awarded for the damage to the specific body part(s). 
This is called the “money chart” and is found in 
LC § 
4660
.   It  is  also  found  in  the  Appendix  to  the  WCAB  
Codebook. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  For  purposes  of  lien  negotiations 
and  settlement,  it  is  imperative  that  LCSAs  understand  
what  benefits  the injured  workers  may  be entitled  to 
and  the  settlement  breakdown.  Always  reference  the  
“money  chart”  to  assess whether  an offer  or  demand 
to   resolve a   lien   is   reasonable.   For   instance,   for 
injuries  occurring  on  or  after  01/01/2014,  the  monetary  
value  of  a  55%  PD  is  $90,262.50.  Knowing  this  will 
make  LCSA  a  more  effective  negotiator  in  maximizing  
collections  from  workers’  compensation claims. 
a. Permanent  Disability  Advances  (PDAs) 
PDAs  are  permanent  disability  benefits  that  are 
paid in advance of settlement of the case. In some 
cases, defendants may be statutorily obligated to 
advance   “reasonable   estimate”   of   PD   benefits. 
Such    advance    payments,    if    required,    shall    
commence 14 days after the date of   last payment of',

TD (LC § 4650). The defendant’s failure to comply 
may    result    in    penalties    and    interests    for    
unreasonable  delay.  
LC  §  5814.  However,  LC  §  
4650  (b)(2)  provides  for  certain  exceptions  to  
advancing PD payments. 
 NOTE: For LCSAs, knowing whether PDAs are 
being  paid  to  the  injured  worker  on  a  claim  will  
help   maximize   WC   liens   collection   efforts   to   
minimize    and/or    mitigate    a    “bleeding    out”    
scenario (further discussion below on bleeding-out 
claims). 
 
D. COLLECTING FROM TD AND PD  
1. Order/Notice    to    Withhold    Income    for Child 
Support (IWO) 
a. Temporary Disability (TD) benefits 
A  TD-IWO  is  used  to  collect  the  total  monthly  
support order (current and arrears) from the injured 
employee’s TD benefits not to exceed 25% of   the TD 
benefits.   (
CCP   §   704.160(c),   FC   §   5206(d); 
Messinese  v.  Workers’  Compensation  Appeals  Bd.  
(2004) 69 Cal. Comp. Cases 480). The IWO must be 
served  on  the  employer’s  insurance  carrier  or  the  
employer   if   the   employer   is   self-insured   for   
workers’ compensation purposes. (
FC § 5246). 
 NOTE:  Collections from TD benefits by way of 
IWO  does  not  require  that  a  lien  be  filed  with  the  
WCAB; however, once TD ends, the IWO no longer 
attaches. Best practice calls for issuance of TD-IWO 
to  the  insurance  company  or  employer  (if  self- 
insured) and concurrently file a lien, pursuant to LC 
§   4903 (e) with the WCAB. 
b. Objection to TD IWO 
If  the  injured  worker  objects  to  the  IWO,  any  legal  
challenge    (i.e.,    request    for    hearing    regarding    
earnings  assignment,  motion  to  quash,  or  other  
proceeding)  must  be  litigated  in  the  IV-D  Court  
(Superior Court). The WCAB does not have subject 
matter  jurisdiction  or  authority  to  decide  issues',

relating  to  the IWO. FC  §  5246(e); Messinese, 
supra; 69 CCC 480 
2. Permanent  Disability  Advances  (PDA) 
If the defendant advances PD payments to the injured 
worker pursuant to LC § 4650,  unlike TD-IWO, there 
is NO current  statutory  authority  which  authorizes 
child  support  deductions  by  an  IWO  against  PDAs.  
For an LCSA, these PDA payments create the problem 
of  a  “bleeding  out”  situation  because  the  value  of  the  
case diminishes with each bi-weekly payment of PDA, 
and in the interim, an LCSA is deprived of the ability 
to  collect  against  these  advances  absent  an  interim  
Order/Award from the WCAB. 
 NOTE: Historically, for various reasons WCJs have 
been hesitant   to   issue   withholding   orders   against   
PDAs,   preferring   to   resolve   LCSA   liens   after   the   
resolution of the case-in-chief. 
However,  in  cases  where  high  percentage  of  PD  is  
reasonably  expected  and  defendant  is  advancing  PD  
payments, there is  a very high probability that most of 
the PD payments will have already been issued to the 
injured  worker  when  the  case-in-chief  is  ready  for  
settlement  or  trial  (hence,  the  case  is  “bleeding  out”).  
This scenario creates irreparable harm to the LCSA and 
waiting  until  the  resolution  of  case-in-chief  will  be  
highly  prejudicial  to  the  LCSA  since  most  of  the  PD  
will have been exhausted and there may be little to no 
PD benefits left to recover through the lien. 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  To  address  this  concern,  an  
LCSA  may  want  to  consider  filing  a  Declaration  of  
Readiness  (DOR).  BE  CREATIVE:  Demonstrate  that  
there  is  irreparable  harm  to  the  LCSA  and  waiting  until  
the  resolution  of  case-in-chief  will  be  highly  prejudicial  
since  there  will  be  little  to  no  PD  benefits  left  to  recover  
against.  Also,  demonstrate  the  necessity  of  the  money 
to   the   Person   Receiving   Support   (PRS)   and   minor   
children,      and      the      consequences      of      delayed      
compensation.  Attach  a  payment  history  showing  long 
periods  of  non-payment  by  the  obligor.  Overall,  WCJs  
should still consider  the best  interest  of  the child.',

Efforts are continuing to enact legislation to correct this 
lack of a statutory basis for such deductions. 
But note, the legal standard under 
LC § 4903 (e) is a 
reasonableness standard   and   the   WCJs   have   wide   
discretion.  Furthermore,  LCSAs  may  face  resistance  
from   the   Applicant   attorney’s   Bar   (the   California   
Association   of   Applicant   Attorney,   or   CAAA).   In   
opposition  to  an  LCSA’s  effort,  an  argument  can  be  
made that the interim Order will thwart the legislative 
intent   of   
LC  §  3202,   which   calls   for   the   liberal   
construction of the Labor Code by the court, with the 
expressed  purpose  of  extending  WC  benefits  for  the  
protection  of  persons  injured  in  the  course  of  their  
employment. 
 
 PRACTICE   POINT: Building   a   good relationship 
with   your   local   Board   Judges   is   important   to   the   
expedient  and  full  collection  of  money  from  Workers’  
Compensation   cases,   especially   in   smaller   counties   
dealing with one primary Board. 
a. Reserving  Sufficient  Money  to  Pay  Child  
Support Lien(s) 
Once  a  lien  has  been  filed  and  served  upon  the  
party responsible for paying compensation to the 
injured worker – usually an insurer – that party 
is responsible for withholding sufficient funds to 
cover  the  lien  until  the  case  is  resolved.  See, 
Waldrum  vs.  Jaeger (1939)  4 CCC  200, Truck 
Insurance vs. WCAB (Cy-Remus) (1997) 62 CCC 
240. See Section D.4. for further discussion. 
3. Child Support Lien against Permanent 
Disability 
LCSAs  can  collect  against  the  injured  worker’s  PD  
benefits by filing and serving a lien pursuant to 
LC § 
4903(e) 
in  the  injured  worker’s  case  filed  with  the  
WCAB,   or   by   filing   an   original   Adjudication   for   
Adjudication themselves (in such case the “Applicant” 
will be the LCSA).

interest in “the reasonable living expenses of   the 
spouse    or    minor    children    of    the    injured    
employee,  or  both,  subsequent  to  the  date  of  
injury.” 
LC § 4903 (e) The WCAB may order the 
support lien be paid from “any sum to be paid as 
compensation,  any  amount”  as  determined  by  
the  Board  Judge  as  they  “deem  proper”. 
LC  §  
4903(e). 
This  provides  wide  discretion  to  the  
WCJ in awarding the child support lien. 
b. Expense    in    Proportion    Appeals    Board    
“Deems Proper” 
LC § 4903 (e) only requires the WCJ to allow the 
lien  “in  the  proportion  that  the  appeals  board  
deems proper.” 
There are no set rules on how much recovery the 
appeals  board  must  allow  for  a  lien,  if  at  all.  In  
deciding what is “proper,” the appeals board has 
wide discretion, and the legal standard on appeal 
is  an  abuse  of  discretion.  
Di  Pasqua  v.  IAC  
(1949) 14 CCC 251 (writ denied). 
In  one  panel  (writ  denied)  decision,  the  LCSA  
filed a lien for child support totaling $13,953.73. 
At   the   time   of   the   hearing   on   the   lien,   the   
applicant  had  about  $13,387  remaining  on  a  
permanent  disability  award.  The  WCJ  allowed  
the lien in full against the applicant''s permanent 
disability  award.  The  WCJ  explained  that  the  
applicant  had  seven  minor  children,  had  not  
provided  any  support,  lived  with  his  parents,  
and was not looking for work. So, the WCJ found 
that  in  balancing  the  equities  of  the  case,  the  
equity  was  entirely  with  the  seven  children.  
Hernandez v. WCAB (1994) 59 CCC 634 (writ 
denied). 
In another case, the WCJ did not allow the lien in 
full.  The  WCJ  allowed  a  lien  for  unpaid  child  
support filed by the county in proportion to the 
applicant''s earnings previously payable as child 
support. The WCJ explained that the applicant''s',

.   County   of   Sutter   v.   
WCAB (Neel) (1990) 55 CCC 313 (writ denied). 
In comparison, there are also supporting case law 
authorities  holding  that  it  was  not  an  abuse  of  
discretion for the WCJ to disallow the LCSA liens 
altogether.  The  factors  in  the  lien  disallowed  
cases and supporting decision were: 
(1) the permanent disability award was relatively 
small;  (2)  the  applicant  had  a  new  wife  and  
family to support; and (3) the applicant had been 
required to seek a lighter job at less pay because 
of  the  injury.  See.

would likely have left the injured employee as a 
public charge). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Each  case  must  be evaluated 
on  its  own  facts  with  the  reasonableness  standard  in  
mind.  If  LCSA  comes  off  as  the  “unreasonable”  party,  
remember  that  it  is  not  an  abuse of  discretion  for  WCJ  
to disallow a lien.

 PRACTICE POINT: A court order for child support 
is  NOT  a  prerequisite  for  the  filing  of  a  WCAB  lien.  A  
current   child   support   order,   however,   is   helpful   in   
establishing   an   amount   for   the   reasonable   living   
expenses  of  the  injured  worker’s  minor  child  or  children  
after   the   date   of   injury.   A   letter   to   the   employer’s   
Workers’  Compensation  insurance  carrier  may  also  be  
sufficient  to  protect  the  LCSA’s  interest,  but  it  is  a 
better   practice to   file   and serve   a   formal   lien.   In 
addition,  the  LCSA  can  only  request  the  amount  of  
arrears  which  accrued  from  the  date  of  injury  forward,  
with  the  Messinese case  exception.  Supra,  Section  
C.1(a). 
 
E. TYPES OF WORKERS’ COMPENSATION 
SETTLEMENT 
1. Two Options: 
Generally,   a   workers’   compensation   case   can   be   
settled  by  a  Compromise  and  Release  (“C&R”)  or  a  
Stipulation  with  Request  for  Award  (“Stip”).  Note,  
however, parties cannot be forced to settle by way of 
a  C&R,  providing  for  a  lump-sum  payment  to  the  
injured   worker.   Effectively,   the   only   alternative   
method of   settlement may be a   Stipulation for weekly 
payments with “future medical left open.” 
a. Compromise and Release (C&R) 
When  the  case  settles  by  a  C  &  R,  the  injured  
worker  agrees  to  settle  the  entire  claim  and  all  
future rights   in   exchange   for   a   lump   sum   
payment.  This  settlement  resolves  ALL  issues 
and  defendant’s  liability,  including  the  right  to  
reopen   and   Petition   for   New   and   Further   
Disability, future medical treatments, and death 
benefits    payable    to    the    injured    worker’s    
dependents. A 
C&R is a full and final resolution 
of the workers’ compensation claim as to  all WC 
issues.  Because  of  the  finality  of  this  type  of  
settlement,  the  parties  and  the  Court  cannot  
force the parties to settle by way of a C&R.

denied”   in   exchange   for   a   quick   lump-sum 
payment  and  claims  closure  by  the  insurance  
company. 
Parties  will  often  C&R  to  “avoid  the  risks  of  
litigation.” Because the real value of the claim is 
not litigated and may be unknown at the time of 
C&R, it is even more critical for LCSAs to  closely 
examine  the  information  from  both  parties  to  
assess the value of the claim in maximizing WC 
liens collections. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  The  C  &  R  payment  is  the  gross  
amount   negotiated   by   the   Applicant’s   Attorney   (or   
Applicant,  if  unrepresented)  and the  insurer  to  settle 
the   case. From   the   gross   amount,   the   following   
deductions   are   made:   credit   for   PDAs   (Permanent   
Disability  Advances)  already  provided  to  the  injured  
worker,  attorney  fees,  EDD  liens  and  any  Temporary  
Disability  overpayments. This  “net”  remaining money 
is  the  amount  the  LCSA  negotiates  to  resolve  the  child  
support lien. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT: It    is  widely  accepted among 
WCJs that if the net settlement can satisfy the LCSA 
lien and leave the injured worker with an equal or 
greater amount of money, the entire lien should be 
requested and paid. If the net settlement does not 
provide sufficient money to satisfy the LCSA lien, 
leaving the injured worker with a share less than half 
of  the  net  proceeds,  the  standard  approach  is  to  request  
the net  proceeds  be  split  50/50.  LCSAs  cannot  collect,  by  
way  of  a  LC  §  4903  lien,  from  a  settlement  if  the  only  
support  owed  consists  of  arrears  that  accrued  prior  to  the  
date of injury at settlement. 
 
b. Stipulation     with     Request     for     Award     
(Stipulation) 
When the case settles by a   stipulation, the parties 
agree  to  a  level  of  permanent  disability  (based  
upon  their  “rating”,  or  “percentage  of  injury”),  
an amount to be paid based upon the rating, and 
a level  of  on-going  medical  care,  as  needed.  
Instead  of  a  lump-sum  payment,  the  injured',

worker   receives   bi-weekly   payments   of   PD   
indemnity capped at a weekly-rate by statute. 
Ex: For injuries on or after 01/01/2014, a 55% PD 
is payable at 311.25 weeks of payment at $290.00 
weekly
 maximum for a Total indemnity of 
$90,262.5 
 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Typically,  stipulations  are  used  
when the  injured worker  continues  employment  with 
the  same  employer  who  is  also  responsible  for  paying  
the ongoing medical care. The injured worker 
continues  to  receive  regular  PD  payments  until  the  full  
amount  of  the  settlement  is  paid,  even  though  the 
injured worker    may    have returned to    work.    A 
Stipulation  resolves  the  PD  benefits,  and  the  injured  
worker  is  still entitled to  receive future  medical  care 
from  the  insurance  carrier  and  can  re-open  the  claim  
within   five   years   from date of   injury   if   the injury 
worsens. LC § 5410. 
 
2. Special   Rules   for   Lump-Sum   Payment   of   Lien   
(“Commutation”) 
While  C&R  agreements  involve  lump-sum payments, 
and  Stipulations  with  Request  for  Awards  normally  
involve continuing, periodic payments, LCSAs should 
request payment of their lien in a lump-sum payment 
by  requesting  “commutation  from the  far end  of  the 
award”. This  allows  the  child  support  lien  to  be  
addressed up front and paid immediately, just like the 
injured worker’s attorney fees, without having to wait 
until the injured worker exhausts his benefits through 
the    fixed    installments    up    to    the    lien    amount.    
Alternatively, the LCSA may seek to obtain an order to 
withhold from the PD payments as noted previously. 
a. C&R settlement of Future Medical Care Only 
Even after the claim settles by stipulation and PD 
indemnity has been paid, an injured worker can 
request  that  the  ongoing  or  future  medical  care  
be  quantified  into  a  lump-sum  payment.  (LC  §  
5100). While a  defendant insurance carrier is not 
required to  settle out the future medical care, it is 
often an advantage to do so to reduce its future',

liabilities  if  the  price  is  right.  It  remains  unclear  
whether  child  support  liens,  pursuant  to  
LC  §  
4903,  can  be  enforced  against  a  C&R  of  Future  
Medical Care only. 
LC § 4903 operates as a lien 
against  “any  sum  to  be  paid  as  compensation.”  
Presently,  there  is  no  legal  authority  to  give  
guidance  on  whether  future  medical  treatment  
only  without  TD  and/or  PD  is  “compensation”  
for purposes of   
LC §   4903 (e) child support lien. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT: Recognizing  the  potential  risks  
and  challenges  outlined  above  will  assist  LCSAs  in  
recouping  an  additional  C&R  lump  sum  amount  during  
lien settlement negotiations. 
3. Special  Consideration  for  Petition  for  New  and  
Further  Disability  after  a  Stipulation  and  Award  
Only 
If  the  WC  case  settled  by  way  of  a  Stipulation,  an  
injured worker can petition the WCAB to reopen the 
workers’  comp  case  to  establish  “new  and  further  
disability” provided the petition is within five years 
after the date of injury. 
LC § 5410. 
In  such  case,  the  injured  worker  alleges  new  and/or  
worsening in the conditions and PD is 
effectively relitigated  to  determine  the  additional  
increase   in   PD,   if   any.   For   LCSAs,   this   is   an   
additional opportunity to collect from the additional 
increase in PD, if any, after the filing of the Petition. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Problems  arise  with  LCSA  liens  
against  these  “new  and  further  disability”  cases  when 
the  LCSA  original  lien  settlement  document  is  unclear 
as  to  the  parties’  intentions  at  the  time  of  the  original  
Stipulation. 
In the original Stipulation and/or the lien settlement 
documents,  it  is  recommended  that  the  LCSA  make  
it  abundantly clear that the Stipulation is NOT a   full 
and    final    resolution    of    the    LCSA    lien.    The    
Stipulation DOES  NOT preclude  the  LCSA  from

compensation,   if   applicable,   should   the   injured',

4.  Failure  of  Insurer to  Satisfy  Support  Lien 
a. Once  a  child  support  lien  has  been  filed  and  
served   upon   the   party   responsible   for   paying   
compensation  to  the  injured  worker,  that  party  
(usually,  the  insurer  –    some  businesses  are  self- 
insured)    must    withhold    sufficient    funds    to 
cover   payment   of   the   lien   until   the   case   is   
resolved. See Waldrum  vs.  Jaeger  (1939)  4  CCC  
200. 
A  lien  claim  filed  more  than  five  months  after a 
Compromise  and  Release  was  not barred  by  the  
doctrine   of   laches   because   the   defendant   had   
knowledge   of   the   potential   lien   claims,   had 
failed  to  investigate  them,  failed  to  notify  lien  
claimants       of       an       applicant''s       workers''       
compensation  claim,  failed  to  disclose  potential  
liens   at   the   time   of   approval   of   a   stipulated

to   “pay   all   unpaid   balances,   for   which   there

 PRACTICE  POINT:  The  deadline to  file  a  Petition 
for  Reconsideration is  calculated from the  date notice 
is  provided to  the  lien  claimant  of  the  settlement.  (LC 
§  5903).  There  have  been  instances  in  which  LCSAs  
have been   able   to   receive   compensation   for   their 
omitted   child   support   liens   several   years   after   the 
original  settlement  was  issued  for  the  parties’  failure  to  
provide notice. 
 NOTE: This may be less true in light of 8 CCR § 
10888  which  requires  the  prompt  filing  of  a  DOR  to  
resolve liens once settlement is reached. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT: If  the  injured  worker  opts  to  
receive  a  lump  sum  for  the  remaining  balance  of  PD  
and/or  future  medical  and  the  original  LCSA  lien  was  
previously  settled,  the  LCSA  should  file  a  new  lien  for  
months  of  support  that  accrued  after  the  last  month  of 
the previously   settled lien   period.   If the insurance 
carrier  or  employer  is  self-insured,  and  is  noticed  of  a  
support  lien,  and  fails  to  withhold  enough  money  to  
satisfy  the  lien,  the  WCAB  judge  can  enter  a  judgment  
against  the  insurer  or  employer  for  either  the amount 
of  the  lien  or  the  amount  paid  to  the  injured  worker,  
whichever is less. CCP § 491.460(c). 
F. DISMISSAL OF LIENS (8 CCR § 10888)  
Effective January  01,  2020,  liens  are  subject  to  dismissal  
pursuant  to 
8  CCR  §   10888 for  “non-prosecution,  non 
appearance  by  the  lien  claimant,  or  failure  to  comply  
with  the  provisions  of  the  Labor  Code  or  these  rules”  
(i.e., other WCAB Rules). An applicant, defendant, or   the 
WCJ on their own motion, can file a   petition for dismissal 
if the lien claimant fails to file a Declaration of   Readiness 
within  either:  a)  180  days  after  the  “underlying  case  of  
the injured worker has been resolved, or has not chosen 
to  proceed  with  the  case”,  or  b)  “180  days  after  a  lien  
conference or lien trial is ordered off calendar if the lien 
claim was at issue”.   8 
CCR § 10888 (b) 
The  WCJ  will  issue  a  Notice  of  Intention  (“NOI”)  to  
Dismiss prior to dismissing the lien.

G. MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES  
1. Electronic Adjudication Management System 
EAMS  is  a  computer-based  management  system 
used  by  the  Division  of    Workers''  Compensation 
(DWC). EAMS allows its internal and external users 
online  access  to  case  information  as  well  as  the 
ability to perform public information cases searches. 
(https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/eams/eams.htm). 
There  are  two  ways  to  file  workers’  compensation  
pleadings through EAMS: 
a. OCR Paper Form Filing 
Filing   is   accomplished   by   mailing   or   hand- 
delivering  existing  hardcopy  OCR  forms  to  the  
WCAB district office. 
b. Electronic Filing 
There are two methods of   electronic filing: 
1) E-Forms 
E-form  filing  is  typically  used  for  smaller  
filings. To file e-forms, you must sign up for a 
log-on  and  password  and  participate  in  a  
mandatory training webinar. 
2) JET-File 
Documents  are  transmitted  through  a  secure  
internet  connection  to  the  State  of  California  
servers where it is picked up by the DWC and 
deposited     into     EAMS.     It     is     a     more     
comprehensive,  high-volume  system  set-up 
through a third-party filer or   software from an 
approved vendor. It allows electronic filing of 
multiple  forms  and  attachments  in  a  single  
transmission.

Once    paid    to    the    injured    worker,    workers''    
compensation  settlement  monies  are  exempt  from  
further  collections.  (
CCP  §  704.160  (a)).  If  the  
money  is  levied  upon  (e.g.,  bank  levy),  the  debtor  
can seek relief by submitting a Claim of Exemption 
to the LCSA. (
CCP § 703.010 et seq). 
 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   If   the   injured   worker   has   
provided  adequate  proof  that  the  source  of  the  levied  
funds    resulted    from    the    workers’    compensation    
settlement,  the  LCSA  should  release  the  funds  without  
requiring a claim of exemption. 
3. General   Considerations   re:   Evidentiary   and   
Procedural Rules 
If  liens  are  not  fully  resolved  at  the  Conference  
hearing, parties must be prepared to sign and file a 
pretrial  conference  statement  (PTCS),  aka  “Five- 
Pager”,  which  includes:  (1)  all  stipulations;  (2)  the  
specific   issues   in   dispute;   (3)   all   documentary   
evidence that might be offered at the lien trial; and 
(4) all witnesses who might testify at the lien trial 
8 
CCR § 10875(d) 
 
 NOTE:  Discovery  closes  on  the  date  of  a  lien  
conference.   Evidence   not   disclosed   or   obtained   
thereafter  will    not    be    admissible    unless    the 
proponent  of  the  evidence  can  demonstrate  that  it  
was not available or could not have been discovered 
by  the  exercise  of  due  diligence  before  the  lien  
conference. 
8 CCR § 10875 (e). 
 
Workers'' compensation trials are informal. All trials 
and hearings before the WCAB are governed by 
LC 
§ 3200 et seq. and by the WCAB Rules. LC § 5708 
Trial  exhibits  must  be  filed  and  served  20  days  
before  trial.  
8  CCR  §  10670.  The  WCAB  is  not  
bound   by   the   Evidence   Code   when   admitting   
evidence at trial or during hearings. 
LC § 5708. 
Nonetheless,  the  evidence  must  have  some  degree  
of   probative force to be considered.

v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (1968) 69 Cal.2d

 PRACTICE  POINT:  If  there  are  other  case-in-chief 
trials  set  on  the  same  day  as  the  child  support  lien  trial,  
priority  is  given  to  cases-in-chief.  But  note  that  cases  
settle  even  the  morning  of  Trial,  so  your  Lien  Trial  may  
proceed. Always be prepared! 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Trial  calendars  are always  set 
at  8:30  a.m.  There  are  multiple  trials  set  on  the  same  
day.  Even  on  the  morning  of  trial,  the  WCJ  will  attempt 
to convince the parties to settle. 
In  the  event  the  trial  goes  forward,  there  is  no  “opening  
statement”  in  a  WC  trial.  Parties  meet  with  the  WCJ  in  
chambers  to  discuss  “Stips  and  Issues.”  WCJs  want  a  
“clean  record”  so  they  usually  go  over  the  issues  with 
the  parties  – this  is  your  opportunity  to  give  an  
“opening statement.” 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  WCAB  lien  trial  is  very  different  
than   civil   trial.   Introduction   and   objections   to   ALL 
Exhibits  must  be  made  in  the  beginning  of  trial  prior  to  
witness  testimonies.  WCJ  is  not  bound  by  Rules  of  
evidence and procedure. 
4. Other Physical  Appearances by  Lien Claimants 
There  are  still  several  instances  in  which  physical  
appearances  by  representatives  of  LCSAs  could  be  
required, including but not limited to, the following: 
Lien  Conferences,  Lien  Trials,  hearings  initiated  by  
LCSAs   (primarily,   Declaration   of   Readiness   to   
address    omitted    LCSA    liens    from    settlement    
documents),  and  any  hearing  in  which  the  Judge  
orders the LCSA to appear. 
 
WCJs  have  the  authority  to  order  lien  claimants  to  
appear  at  MSCs  and  Trials,  notwithstanding  other  
rules. 
8 CCR §    10752 (e).  This makes good relations 
with WCJs increasingly important.

Each LCSA must evaluate its own available resources 
to determine which non-required hearings to cover. 
In  smaller  counties  with  one  primary  Board,  the  
relationship with your Board Judge is    important. In 
metropolitan   areas   with   multiple   Boards,   such   
relationships  are  less  possible.  LCSAs  always  can  
request  assistance  in  making  the  occasional  “out  of  
area” appearance pursuant to 
FC § 17400(o). 
a. Hearing Representative 8 § CCR 10401 
Non-attorneys  are  authorized  by  the  Board  to  
make   appearances,   generally   to   collect   child   
support   liens.   They   must   carry   a   “Notice   of   
Representation”  letter  or  document  with  them  
which  identifies  whom  they  are  appearing  on  
behalf  of  and  be  prepared  to  file  a  “Notice  of  
Appearance”  with  the  Board,  if  requested  by  the  
WCJ, which outlines this same information. 
WCJ   may   “remove   or   suspend”   non-attorney 
representatives  for  “good  cause”  after  a  hearing.  
“Good  cause”  is  defined  as  “serious  or  repeated  
violations”  of  DWC  rules,  or  failure  to  pay  an  
order of sanctions, attorney fees or costs under

ENFORCEABLE AFTER DEATH 
1. Obligation  Survives  Death 
A child support obligation survives the death of the 
supporting parent and is a charge against his or her 
estate.   (IRMO   Perry (1997)   58 Cal.App.4
th
   1104, 
1106).  
 NOTE: CSS Letter 06-39 prohibits the LCSA from 
opening   a   case   when   the   supporting   parent   is   
already   deceased.   However,   it   does   not   require   
closure   of   an   open   case   upon   the   death   of   the   
supporting parent. 
2. Modification 
A deceased noncustodial parent’s support obligation 
is  subject  to  modification  as  to  amounts  not  yet  
accrued   on   a   satisfactory   showing   of   changed   
circumstances.
    (IRMO Bertrand (1995) 33 
Cal.App.4
th
 437, 440). 
B. PROBATE ESTATES OF DECEASED OBLIGORS    
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  “Probate  estates”  are  those  in  
which  the  decedent’s  property  passes  by  way  of  a  will, 
or  where the decedent  died intestate (without  a  will), 
but  do  not  include  estates  controlled  by  a  trust  or  
property  that  passes  by  contract  or  other  vehicle  (e.g.,  
life insurance, joint tenancy deed, etc.). 
1. Creditor Claim 
A person or entity who may have a  claim against the 
estate  of  a  decedent  is  a  creditor  and  must  file  a  
creditor claim (JCF DE-172) to demand payment for 
a  liability  of  the  decedent.  (
Prob.  Code  §  9000,  et  
seq.).  The  LCSA  should  only  file  a  creditor  claim  
when  there  is  an  existing  probate  action.  Due  to  
fiduciary  and  liability  issues,  it  is  generally  advised  
that the LCSA not attempt to initiate its own probate 
action where one does not already exist.

The   personal   representative   of   the   estate   is   
required   to   give   notice   to   “the known   or   
reasonably ascertainable     creditors     of     the     
decedent.” (
Prob. Code § 9050(a)). 
b. Time for Filing Claims 
A  creditor  must  file  a  claim  within  four  months  
after  letters  of  administration  are  issued  or  60  
days after the creditor receives notice, whichever 
occurs later. (
Prob. Code § 9100(a)). 
c. Documentation 
A creditor claim shall be filed with the court and 
a    copy    shall    be    served    on    the    personal    
representative. (
Prob. Code § 9150). 
d. Accepting or Rejecting the Claim 
Once  a  creditor  claim  is  filed,  the  administrator  
must  accept  or  reject  the  claim  in  writing,  in  
whole or in part. (
Prob. Code § 9250(a)) There 
is  no  statutory  time  limit  to  accept  or    reject  a 
claim,  but failure  to  accept  it  within  30 days 
may,  at  the  creditor’s  option,  be  treated  as  a  
rejection,    thereby    entitling    the    creditor    to    
maintain  an  action  on  the  claim  (
Prob.  Code  §  
9256).  If the claim is rejected, or no acceptance is 
received  within  30  days,  the  creditor  may  file  
suit    on    the    claim    or    request    summary    
determination  within  90  days.  (
Prob.  Code  §  
9353).  Prior to taking this step, however, it may 
be   advisable   for   the   LCSA   to   contact   the   
administrator   to   clarify   his   or   her   intention   
relative to the claim. 
e. Priority of Payments 
Debts  which  are  owed  to  the  United  States  or  
State   of   California   have   priority   as   may   be   
required by law. The priority of all other types of 
debts are as follows: 
1) expenses of   administration; 
2) obligations secured by mortgage, trust deed, 
or other lien, including a judgment lien;',

3) funeral expenses; 
4) last illness expenses; 
5) family allowance; 
6) wage claims; 
7) general   debts,   including   judgments   not   
secured   by   a   lien   (e.g.   DCSS   support   
judgments),  and  “all  other  debts”.  (
Prob. 
Code § 11420). 
 NOTE:  In  most  cases,  child  support  debt  
will fall under the category of “general debts” 
(last in priority). The priority given to support 
obligations under 
FC § 4011 does not apply to 
trust or estate claims. 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   Filing   a   Request   for   Special   
Notice  (JCF  DE-154)  pursuant  to  Prob.  Code  §  1250 
et  seq.  will  ensure  that  notice  of  all  further  actions  is  
made to  the LCSA.  It    is  recommended that  this  form 
be  filed  in  conjunction  with  any  document  filed  in  a  
probate action. 
C. TRUST ESTATES OF DECEASED OBLIGORS  
1. Claim 
A person who may have a claim against the trust is a 
creditor,  and  must file  a  claim  to  demand  payment 
for a liability of the decedent. (
Prob. Code 
§   19000, et seq.). 
a. Notice to Creditors 
The  trustee  is  required  to  give  notice  to  known  
creditors of   the settlor (decedent). (
Prob. Code § 
19050). 
b. Time for Filing Claims 
A  creditor  must  file  a  claim  within  four  months  
after the first publication of   notice to creditors or 
60  days  after  the  date  actual  notice  is  mailed  or  
personally  delivered  to  the  creditor,  whichever  
occurs later. (
Prob. Code § 19100(a)). 
c. Documentation 
A claim shall be filed with the court and a copy 
shall be mailed or   delivered to the trustee. (

Code § 19150). The claim shall be supported by 
an affidavit of the creditor or a person acting on 
behalf of the creditor. (
Prob. Code § 19151). If a 
claim   is   based   on   a   written   instrument,   the   
instrument shall be attached to the claim. (
Prob. 
Code  §  19152
).  There  is  not  a  specific  Judicial  
Council Form to file a   claim against a   trust estate, 
but  the  Notice  of  Lien  form  (JCF  AT-180)  is  
frequently used in these cases.  The LCSA should 
attach  a  certified  copy  of  the  support  judgment  
and/or order to its Notice of Lien.
 
 NOTE: This is not the same mechanism used 
when  the  obligor  is  a  beneficiary  of  a  trust  
(discussed in Paragraph E., below). 
D. OBLIGOR AS THE BENEFICIARY OF A PROBATE 
ESTATE 
 
1. File a   Notice of Lien 
If  an  obligor  is  the beneficiary  of    a    probate  (non-
trust)  estate,  the  LCSA  may  file  a  lien  in  the  action 
pursuant to 
CCP §  708.410. The LCSA must file the 
Notice  of  Lien  with  an  abstract  or  certified  copy  of  
the money judgment.  (JCF  AT-180, JCF EJ-185). It  is  
a good practice to also include an arrears accounting 
with your lien, since many courts require it. 
2. Avoidance  of  Support  Obligations 
a. Assigning One’s Rights 
A  beneficiary  of  an  estate  is  generally  free  to  
assign  his  or  her  rights  during  the  course  of  
estate  administration.  However,  the  probate 
court   has    discretion    to    inquire    into    the    
circumstances  surrounding  the  execution  of  
an  assignment  and  may  refuse  to  allow  the  
assignment   if   equity   so   demands.   (
Prob. 
Code § 11604). 
 NOTE: If a child support obligor attempts to 
assign  his/her  interest  in  an  estate  to  avoid  a  
child support obligation, the LCSA can file for 
an injunction to prevent this.',

b. Disclaimers 
A beneficiary of an estate may also “disclaim” 
his  or  her  interest  in  the  estate  by  filing  a  
“Disclaimer of Interest.” (
Prob. Code § 260 et 
seq.
)   With   the   disclaimer,   the   disclaiming   
party  is  treated as  having  predeceased  the 
testator  (
Prob.  Code  §  282),  so  the  obligor  
would have no interest in the estate from which 
the    LCSA    could    collect    child    support.    
Disclaimers, by statute, are not voidable (
Prob. 
Code § 283
), but the timeliness of   a    disclaimer 
may be an issue (
Prob. Code §   279 sets out the 
time  limits  –    conclusively  reasonable  if  filed  
within  nine  months  after  death  of  testator).  A  
valid  disclaimer  will  prevent  the  LCSA  from  
collecting   against   the   interest   of   an   estate   
beneficiary. 
E. OBLIGOR   AS   A   BENEFICIARY   OF   A   TRUST 
ESTATE 
1. Support  is  Payable  from  Beneficiary’s  Interest  
Under 
Prob.   Code   §   15305,    a    claimant    for    
delinquent  child  or  spousal  support  can  reach  a  
beneficiary’s interest in a trust. 
Prob. Code § 15306 
allows the LCSA to request reimbursement for public 
assistance. 
2. Spendthrift  Provision 
Spendthrift  provisions  are   common   in   revocable   
trusts.  The  purpose  of  such  provisions  is to prevent 
creditors  from  attaching  a  debtor’s  interest  in  the  
trust, generally by giving the trustee discretion as to 
when   or   if   to   make   distributions   to   the   debtor   
beneficiary. However, a   child’s right to support is not 
defeated   by   a   spendthrift   provision   in   a   trust   
instrument.   Courts   have   discretion   to   order   the   
trustee to satisfy all or part of the support judgment 
from all or part of the beneficiary’s interest (Ventura 
County  DCSS  v.  Brown (2004)  117 Cal.App.4
th
  144; 
Pratt  v.  Ferguson  (2016)  3  Cal.App.5th  102;

3.Petition  to   Enforce  Money Judgment
The    mechanism    for    collecting    money    from    a
beneficiary of a trust (any kind of trust, be it a trust
estate or otherwise) is to prepare and file a  Petition to
Enforce    a    Money    Judgment    Against    a    Trust
Beneficiary  with  the  Probate  Court  in  the  county  in
which the trust is being administered. (
Prob. Code §
15301
; CCP  §  709.010(b)).   There   is   no   Judicial
Council Form for this petition.
4.Trustee  Liability
If   a   trustee   has   been   served   with   process   in   a
proceeding  filed  by  the  LCSA  seeking  to  reach  the
obligor’s  interest  in  a  trust,  and  the  trustee  makes
discretionary  payments  to  the  obligor,  the  trustee  is
liable  to  the  judgment  creditor  (LCSA  or  obligee)  to
the extent that the payment to the obligor impairs the
right of the creditor. (
Prob. Code § 15303(b)).
PRACTICE  POINT:  If  there  is  no  existing  action
regarding  the  trust,  the LCSA  can  create  a new court
case  by  filing  its  Petition  to  Enforce  with  the  Probate
Court pursuant to FC § 17400 and FC § 17406. Unlike 
initiating  a  probate  action,  the  filing  of  a  Petition  to  
Enforce creates  no fiduciary  duties  or  liability  issues. 
5.Court  Discretion
If “the court determines it is equitable and reasonable
under  the  circumstances  of  the  particular  case,”  the
court may order the trustee to satisfy all or part of a
support judgment out of the beneficiary’s interest in
the trust. (
Prob. Code § 15305(c)).
PRACTICE POINT:    While CCP  § 709.010(b)
states    the    obligor’s    interest    is    only    subject    to
enforcement   by   petition to   the   court,   past   practice
shows  that  an  income  withholding  order  to  the  trustee
will often be honored.
F.CUSTODIAL PARTY AS DECEDENT
1.Ongoing  Support  Order  Continues
A  child  support  obligation  survives  the  death  of  a
custodial
    parent.    (IRMO    Gregory    (1991)    230

custodial  parent,  the  LCSA  will  not  continue  to  
collect support on behalf of an estate. (See CSS Letter 
11-13). 
2. Child  Support  is an Estate  Asset
C
hild support arrears owed to a deceased custodial
parent is an asset of his/her estate. Thus, it is subject
to  distribution  by  a  court  to  the  decedent’s  heirs  or
beneficiaries,  according  to  law (not  necessarily  the
decedent’s  children)  (
Prob.  Code  §  7000).  As  an  
estate  asset,  a  debt  owing  to  the  custodial  party  
(decedent) can be transferred in the same manner as 
any other estate property, although the LCSA cannot 
enforce the right to receive support when transferred 
to a third party. 
G.    OTHER TRANSFER VEHICLES
In   addition   to   trusts   and   estates   (both   probate   and
intestate),  there  are  additional  methods  of  transferring
property after death.  These non-probate transfer vehicles
include  jointly-held  property  with  right  of  survivorship
(e.g.,  joint  tenancy  deeds),  contractual  agreements  (e.g
.,
l
ife  insurance),  small  property  affidavits  for  personal
property not exceeding $166,250 (
Prob. Code § 13100, et 
seq.),   and small  property affidavits  for real  and  personal 
property not exceeding $166,250 (Prob. Code §  13150, et 
seq.).  Transfers  made  via  such  mechanisms  are  usually 
done  quickly,  without  court  involvement. Due  to  the  
nature of these transfer mechanisms, it is highly unlikely 
that an LCSA will succeed in collecting from these types 
of non-probate transfers.',

1. Bankruptcy  Abuse  Prevention  and  Consumer  
Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) 
The   legislative   act   that   made   several   significant   
changes to the Bankruptcy Code starting October 17, 
2005. (11 USC § 101 et seq.) 
2. Debtor 
The  person  or  business  that  owes  money  and  has  
filed for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. (11 USC § 
101(13)) 
3. Creditor 
The  person  or  business  who  claims  to  be  owed  
money by the Debtor. (11 USC § 101(10)) 
4. Domestic  Support  Obligation  (DSO) 
All types of family-related  support,  including  child,  
spousal, family, medical, educational, transportation, 
past,   present,   and   future,   whether   assigned   or   
unassigned, including interest. (11 USC §   101(14)(A)) 
5. Automatic  Stay 
Prohibits  Creditors  from  pursuing  the  Debtor  for  
payment  (with  some  exceptions);  however,  the  stay  
automatically       stops       lawsuits,       foreclosures,       
garnishments,  and  all  collection  activity.  (11  USC  §  
362) 
6. Bankruptcy  Estate 
A fictional estate that is owned and managed by the 
Trustee  upon  filing  the  petition  for  bankruptcy;  the  
Debtor transfers all assets into the bankruptcy estate 
and no longer owns the assets. 
7. Property of  the  Estate

9. Discharge 
The release of   a Debtor from further personal liability 
for certain debts. (11 USC § 727 and 11 USC § 1328) 
B. TYPES OF BANKRUPTCY  
1. Bankruptcy  Code  Chapters 
There are different types of bankruptcy chapters and 
corresponding protections depending on the chapter 
of  relief  sought.  All  bankruptcy  petitions  must  be  
filed  under  a  specific  chapter  of  the  Bankruptcy  
Code. 
2. Chapter  7  “Liquidation  Bankruptcy” 
a. Permits  a  Debtor  to  discharge  most  debt  in  
exchange   for   giving   up   property   that   is   not   
exempt,  which  is  turned  over  to  the  Trustee  to  
distribute to Creditors who file claims. (11 USC § 
701 et seq.) 
b. The Debtor then receives a discharge of certain 
debts, releasing the Debtor from further personal 
liability. (11 USC § 727) 
c. Short  duration,  lasting  usually  no  more  than  4  
months. (FRBP 4004(c)).  
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  In  most  Chapter  7  cases  there 
are  no  assets  available  for  distribution  to  Creditors,  so  
most  Creditors  do  not  have  to  file  claims  against  the  
estate.  If  there  are  assets,  the  Creditor  may  receive  a  
Notice  to  File  Proof  of  Claim  due  to  Possible  Recovery 
of  Assets,  at  which  point  a  proof  of  claim  should be 
filed. 
3. Chapter       13       “Wage-Earner       Plan”       or       
“Reorganization” 
a. Permits  a  Debtor  with  regular  income  to  keep  
his/her property while repaying Creditors, in full 
or   in part, in installments over a  three to five-year 
period. (11 USC § 1301 et seq.)

prohibited  from  starting  or  continuing  collection

d. Property of   the estate includes all assets owned 
on  the  date  of  filing,  and  all  income  the  Debtor  
anticipates  receiving  during  the  pendency  of  the  
bankruptcy. (11 USC § 541 and 11 USC § 1306) 
e. The Debtor must file a Plan, and the Trustee will 
proceed  to  pay  all  Creditors  according  to  their  
priority in the Plan. (11 USC §   1321 and 11 USC § 
1326) 
f. What  should  you  do  if  you  receive  notice  of  a  
Chapter 13 bankruptcy? 
1) File  a  Proof  of  Claim,  with  a  copy  of  the  
child    support    judgment    and    an    audit    
showing  arrears  owed.  (See  FRBP  3001(c)(1) 
and (2).) 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  The  arrears  amount  claimed  by  
the Debtor  in  the  Plan  will  control  payments  unless  you  
file  a  Proof  of  Claim.  The  arrears  amount  in  the  Proof 
of  Claim  will  control  unless  the  Debtor  objects  to  the  
Proof  of  Claim,  in  which  case  the  court’s  ruling  on  the  
Objection controls.  (FRBP  3001(f);  11 USC  §  502(a)) 
If  the  Debtor  files  an  Objection,  see  Section  I,  infra.  A  
claim  cannot  be  augmented  to  include  interest  that  will  
accrue  during  the  Plan  under  11  USC  §  502(b)(2). 
Similarly,   a   claim   cannot   be   made   for   future   child 
support  that  has  not  yet  accrued  under  11  USC  §  
502(b)(1) 
2) If the obligor owes arrears and no ongoing 
support, the LCSA should state on the Proof 
of   Claim form that the arrears accrue interest 
at  10%  per  year.  The  Trustee  can  adjust  
payments to provide for the continuation of 
the 10% interest to allow the total amount of 
arrears    to    be    paid    in    full    when    the    
bankruptcy is discharged. 
 
 PRACTICE POINT: The LCSA should immediately 
load    the    bankruptcy    in    CSE,    which    automatically 
places suppressions; however, the suppressions will 
not impact a wage assignment that is already in place.

unsecured debt totals that exceed the Chapter 13 
limits to restructure and repay his or her debts. (11 
USC § 1101 et seq.) 
b. Debtor  must  file  a  Plan  of  Reorganization  to  
specify how Creditors will be paid either in full or 
at a   pro-rata share, usually in 3   to 5 years. (11 USC 
§ 1123) 
c. If   an   obligor’s   employer   files   this   type   of   
bankruptcy,     the     obligor’s     wages     may     be     
garnished, but not paid as support. The obligor is 
the  Creditor  and  would  have  to  file  a  Proof  of  
Claim. (County of Shasta v. Twig Smith (1995) 38 
Cal.App.4

 329) 
d. No  Income  Withholding  Order  may  be  served  
upon    the    Debtor-Business    for    this    type    of    
bankruptcy. 
C. REQUEST FOR NOTICE  
1. Written  Notice 
Bankruptcy Trustees are required to provide written 
notice to the State child support agency regarding a 
bankruptcy. (11 USC § 704(c), 11 USC § 1106(c), and 
11 USC § 1302(d)) 
2. Request  for  Notice 
A  LCSA  should  file  and  serve  a  Request  for  Notice  
pursuant to 11 USC § 342(f) if the preferred address 
for  notice  for  the  LCSA  is  not  listed  on  the  List  of  
Creditors. 
D. APPEARANCE OF CHILD SUPPORT CREDITOR   
1. Admission 
Bankruptcy rules require that the appearing attorney 
be  admitted  to  practice  law  in  the  federal  district.  
(FRBP 9010(a)). 
2. Exception 
However,   there   is   a   special   exception   for   child   
support  Creditors,  who  may  appear  and  intervene  
without charge, and without meeting the local rules 
regarding  attorney  appearances,  in  any  bankruptcy  
court or district court. (Public Law 103-394, see also

E. AUTOMATIC STAY  
1. Generally 
The    automatic    stay    prohibits    Creditors    from    
pursuing  the  Debtor  for  payment,  filing  lawsuits,  
seeking foreclosures, obtaining garnishments, and all 
other  collection  activity  against  the  Debtor  by  most  
Creditors the moment the petition is  filed. (11 USC § 
362(a)) 
a. Property that is not in the bankruptcy estate is 
exempt   from   the   automatic   stay.   (11   USC   §   
362(b)(2)(B)) 
b. Actions  to  establish  paternity,  establish  child  
support, and modify child support are not subject 
to the automatic stay. (11 USC § 362(b)(2)(A)) 
2. Permissible     Support     Enforcement     Actions     
Certain   support   enforcement   actions   are   exempt 
from the automatic stay, even against property of   the 
bankruptcy estate: 
a. Income Withholding Order 
An     Income     Withholding     Order     is     valid,     
notwithstanding  the  filing  of  a  bankruptcy,  for  
both  current  support  and  arrears.  (11  USC  §  
362(b)(2)(C)) 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  If  the  LCSA  plans  to  keep  
the  wage  assignment  in  place,  rather  than  filing  a  
proof  of  claim,  the  LCSA  should obtain a  written 
agreement  from  the  Trustee  to  explain  why  a  proof  
of  claim  is  not  filed.  Additionally,  in  a  Chapter  13,  
the  Plan  should  be  analyzed  to  ascertain  if  child  
support arrears are explicitly paid through the Plan. 
If   so,   the   Income   Withholding   Order   should   be   
amended  for  current  support  only  since  garnishing  
monies   for   arrears   would   violate the express 
provisions  of  the Plan.  (See 11 USC § 1327)',
  '3. Form',
  232
);

b. Driver’s  License  Suspension  or  Revocation  
Suspending or   revoking driver’s, professional and 
recreational licenses does not violate the 
automatic   stay.   (11 USC   § 362(b)(2)(D))   (See 
below regarding releasing licenses). 
1) Chapter 13 Proceedings: 
Although     suspending     or     revoking     a     
professional   or   driver’s   license   may   not   
violate   the   automatic   stay,   suspending   a   
license  in  a  Chapter  13  proceeding  where  
there  is  an  existing  Confirmed  Plan,  may  be  
inconsistent   with   the   Plan.   Courts   have   
opined  that  a  Debtor’s  driver’s  license  was  
“necessary and appropriate to [...] further the 
implementation  of  the  Debtor’s  confirmed  
Plan.” (See In re Cobb (2006),  Bankr. N.D. Ga. 
.)   LEXIS   2273   [nonpubl.opn].)   Therefore,   
where suspension of   a   license may impact the 
flow  of  funds  into  the  Plan,  an  LCSA  may  
consider  not  suspending  or  revoking  such  
license. 
c. Passport Restriction 
An LCSA may submit a   passport denial request to 
the   Department   of   State   after   a   bankruptcy   
petition  has  been  filed.  (See  Federal  Office  of  
Child  Support  Enforcement,  PIQ-07-04,  citing  22 
CFR  §  51.60(a)(2)  and 22  CFR  §  51.7,  providing  
that  a  passport  is  not  property  of  the  estate,  and  
therefore, not subject to the automatic stay. 
d. Credit Reporting 
Reporting overdue support obligations to a credit 
reporting   agency   is   not   a   violation   of   the   
automatic stay. (11 USC § 362(b)(2)(E)) 
e. Tax Intercept 
It  is  not  a  violation  of  the  automatic  stay  to  
intercept  a  tax  refund  for  support.  (11  USC  §  
362(b)(2)(F)). (But see below discussion in section 
F,2(a)(1),  regarding  tax  intercepts  in  Chapter  13  
proceedings.)

The enforcement of   medical support orders is  not 
a violation  of    the automatic  stay.  (11  USC  § 
362(b)(2)(G)) 
g. Abstracts of Judgments 
Placing  a  lien  on  property  in  the  Debtor’s  estate  
violates  the  automatic  stay.  (11  USC  §  362
 (a)(4) 
and (5)) However, the recording of an abstract of 
judgment or certified copy of the judgment under 
California  law  places  a  lien  for  unpaid  support 
only on the interest of   the Debtor in the property, 
not   the   interest   of   the   estate.   Therefore,   the   
continued practice of recording support abstracts 
or    judgments  would  appear  not  to  violate  the  
stay,  although  execution  on  the  abstract  likely  
would.  (In  re  Cady  (9th  Cir.  2001),  266  B.R.  172,  
181, aff’d, 315 F.3d 1121) 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Generally,  a  Debtor  may  avoid  
(remove)  a  Creditor’s  lien  on  his/her  property  if  that  lien  
interferes  with  the  Debtor’s  right  to  an exemption in 
that  property.  There  is  an  exception  to  this  rule  for  
support  liens.  No  lien  securing  the  payment  of  any  
domestic  support  obligation  may  be avoided.  (11  USC 
§ 522(f)(1)(A)) 
h. Criminal Bankruptcy Enforcement 
The prosecution of   a   criminal action (PC §   270; PC 
§    166)  is  not  stayed.  (11  USC  §    362(b)(1); In  re 
Gruntz (9th Cir. 2000) 202 F.3d 1074)) 
i. Civil Contempt 
Courts have varying opinions as to whether a   civil 
contempt  violates  the  automatic  stay  provision. 
Some courts have found that if the sole purpose of 
the  contempt  is  to  punish  or  uphold  a  court’s  
dignity, the contempt proceeding is  not stayed. (In 
re  Dingley  (2014,  B.A.P.  9th  Cir.)  514  B.R.  591;  In 
re Rook (1989, Bankr. E.D. Va.) 102 B.R. 490; In re 
Lowery  (2003  E.D.  Mo.)  292  B.R.  645).  However,  
where   the   contempt   proceeding   is   strictly   to   
enforce   or   coerce   payment   of   a   debt,   such   
proceeding has been found to be prohibited by the 
stay. (In re Stovall (1990 Bankr. N.D. Ga.) 126 B.R.',
  '3. Form',
  234
);

814)  As  such,  the  case  law  suggests  that  civil  
contempt proceedings solely seeking to punish (as 
opposed  to  coerce  payment)  are  not  barred  from  
the   automatic   stay.   However,   based   on   the   
varying   opinions   of   courts,   a   civil   contempt   
should NOT be filed when the automatic stay is in 
place. 
3. Enforcement      Actions      that      Violate      the 
Automatic Stay 
a. FIDM Bank Levies 
Enforcement  against  property  of  the  bankruptcy  
estate  violates  the  automatic  stay.  Although  the  
data   match   process   itself   remains   active,   a   
participant-level  bank  levy  suppression  should  
remain in place until the bankruptcy is concluded. 
For  additional  guidance,  see  CSS  Letter  12-02 
“Restrictions     on     Enforcement     Actions     for     
Bankruptcy.” 
b. Harassing the Debtor 
Contacting   the   Debtor   to   ask   when   the   next   
payment will be made violates the automatic stay. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  LCSAs  may  want  to  consider  
noting  an  obligor’s  bankruptcy  filing  in  CSE  under  the  
Special   Circumstances   at   the   Participant   Level   to 
inform   caseworkers   that   the   obligor   should   not   be   
“harassed.” 
c. Debtor’s Examination 
Filing  an  Order  to  Show  Cause  for  a  Debtor’s  
Examination violates the automatic stay. 
d. Civil Contempt 
Filing a civil contempt action may be interpreted 
as violating the stay and should not be filed. (See 
above, Section E, 2, (i)) 
e. Negotiating a   SLMS Release 
The    automatic    stay    prohibits    LCSAs    from    
negotiating   a   SLMS   release   with   the   Debtor   
directly  (but  the  LCSA  may  negotiate  a  release  
with the Debtor''s attorney or the Trustee).

for   violation   of   an   automatic   stay   includes   
attorney fees incurred in prosecuting an action for 
damages caused by the violation.]) 
F. EFFECT OF CONFIRMATION ORDER  
1. Confirmation     Order     Is     Binding     on     All 
Creditors 
The provisions of a confirmed Plan bind the Debtor 
and each Creditor, whether or not the claim of such 
Creditor is provided for by the Plan, and whether or 
not   such   Creditor   has   objected   to,   accepted,   or   
rejected the plan. (11 USC § 1327) 
2. Permissible   Actions   Dictated   by   Terms   of   
Confirmation Order 
Even  if  an  action  is  not  prohibited  by  the  automatic  
stay,   an   action   may   still   be   prohibited   by   the   
confirmation  order.  Whether  an  action  is  allowed  
may  be   dictated by  the   terms   of     the   confirmed 
bankruptcy  Plan.  (11  USC  §  1327; In  re  Gellington  
(N.D.Tex.2007) 363  B.R.  497  citing In  re  Murray  
(S.D.Ohio 2006) 350 B.R. 408; In re McGrahan (1st Cir.

a. Tax Intercepts: 
Ensure  that  the Official  Form  or    the Local 
Form  plan  does  not  address  the  treatment  of  
the  Debtor’s  tax  refund.  If  there  is  an  express  
provision  in  the  Plan  that  accounts  for  the 
Debtor’s tax refund, the LCSA should
 
suppress its ability to intercept the tax refund, 
seek to amend the Plan, or seek relief from the 
Bankruptcy  Court,  as  interception  could  be 
interpreted as   violating   the terms   of     the 
confirmed plan, contrary to 11 USC §   1327(a). 
 Central   District of   California   Local 
Plan: 
This   plan   expressly   provides   for   the   
treatment of the Debtor’s tax refund in the 
standard   language   of   the   plan.   LCSAs   
should  suppress  its  ability  to  intercept  or  
seek      appropriate      relief      from      the 
bankruptcy  court  before  intercepting  the  
Debtor’s tax refund. 
 Southern  District  of  California  Local  
Plan: 
This  plan  allows  the  debtor  (subject  to  
ultimate  plan  approval)  to  elect  how  tax  
refunds  are  treated  under  the  plan.  (See  
section  2.4  of  the  Southern  District  Plan).  
LCSA should review section 2.4 of   this plan 
to  determine  appropriate  suppressions,  if  
any, relating to interception of   the debtor’s 
tax refund. 
 Northern   and   Eastern   Districts   of   
California Local Plans 
These  plans  do  not  expressly  provide  for  
the  treatment  of  the  debtor’s  tax  refund.

3. Sanctions 
In one case, a   court found that Florida Department of 
Revenue (FDR) violated 11 USC §   1327(a) when they 
intercepted a check issued to a Debtor despite the fact 
that the confirmed plan included payment in full of 
the  DSO,  and  as  a  result,  the  FDR  was  subject  to  
sanctions,  payment  of  Debtor’s  attorney  fees  and  
costs,  and  potentially  compensatory  and  punitive  
damages.  (In  re  Gonzalez  (2016)  832  F.3d  1251;  see  
also In  re  Rodriguez  (11th  Cir.  Fla.  2010) 367  Fed.  
App’x.   25   [State   was   required   to   pay   Debtor’s   
attorney fees for expenses incurred trying to fend off 
collection  actions  and  imposed  a  fine  of  $10,000  for  
each   of   the   three   stay   violations   (but   the   court   
allowed  the  state  to  purge  this  fine  by  not  sending  
any further letters in violation of the stay)]). 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  If  a  proposed  plan  improperly  
restricts   child   support   enforcement,   an   objection   to   
confirmation of the plan should be filed. 
G. OBJECTION TO CONFIRMATION  
1. Objection  to  Confirmation 
Objections to Confirmation may be filed in response 
to a   petition where the Debtor’s plan does not comply 
with 11 USC § 1322 and 11 USC § 1325. Grounds for 
objecting include: 
a. Failure to  Plan for Full Payment of DSO 
The plan fails to provide for the full payment of   a 
priority claim of   a DSO unless the holder agrees to 
a  different  treatment.  (11  USC  §  1322(a)(2))  The  
Debtor can provide for less than full payment for 
an  assigned  11  USC  §  507(a)(1)(B)  claim  if  all  of  
Debtor’s projected disposable income for a   5-  year 
period  will  be  applied  to  make  payments  under  
the plan. (11 USC § 1322(a)(4)) 
1) Definition of “Assigned”: 
Under 11   USC   §   507(a)(1)(B),   “assigned”   
means     monies     owed     directly     to     the     
government.    Arrears    are    not    “assigned”    
simply  because  the  government  is  collecting  
on  behalf  of  a  custodial  parent  – the  monies',

have to be owed directly to the government to 
be   deemed   “assigned”   under   11   USC   §   
507(a)(1)(B).  (In  re  Penaran  (2010  Bankr.  D.  
Kan.) 424 B.R. 868) 
b. Lack of Good Faith 
The plan has not been proposed in good faith. (11 
USC  §  1325(a)(3)).  The  factors  for  determining  
good   faith   include   the   duration   of   the   plan,   
preferential treatment of   classes of   Creditors, and 
the  type  of  debt  to  be  discharged.  A  bankruptcy  
court  must  consider  “the  totality  of  the  debtor’s  
conduct,   both   before   and   after   the   plan   is   
submitted... when evaluating whether the debtor 
has acted in good faith.” (In re Doersam (9th Cir. 
1988) 849 F.2d 237). Specifically, the court should 
consider   “the   circumstances   under   which   the   
debtor    has    contracted    his    debts    and    his    
demonstrated  bona  fides,  or  lack  of  same,  in  
dealing with his creditors.” (Ibid.) 
c. Plan is Not Feasible 
The  plan  is  not  feasible  since  the  Debtor  will  not  
be able to make all payments under the plan and 
comply with the plan. (11 USC §   1325(a)(6)) When 
a   Debtor   demonstrates   inability   to   meet   his   
current  support  obligations,  he  cannot  propose  a  
feasible plan. 
d. Failure to Pay Current Support 
Debtor  has  not  paid  current  support  since  filing  
for  bankruptcy.  (11  USC  §  1325(a)(8)  [the  debtor  
must pay “all amounts that are required to be paid 
under a   domestic support obligation and that first 
become payable after the date of the filing of the 
petition...”]).   Similarly,   11   USC   §   1307(c)(11)   
permits  dismissal  of  a  petition  for  “failure  of  the  
Debtor  to  pay  any  domestic  support  obligation  
that  first  becomes  payable  after  the  date  of  the  
filing of   the petition.” One of   the requirements for 
confirmation   is   that   the   Debtor   has   paid   all   
amounts  owed  pursuant  to  a  DSO  payable  after  
the  date  of  the  filing  of  the  petition.  (11  USC  §',

1325(b)(1)(B)) 
H. PROOF OF CLAIM  
1. Proof of Claim 
A  claim  is  a  demand  for  payment  from  the  Debtor.  
(11 USC § 101(5)). The official bankruptcy form used 
for  this  demand  for  payment  is  called  a  “Proof  of  
Claim” (Bankruptcy Form B 410). A Creditor files this 
written statement with the bankruptcy court proving 
why   the   Debtor   owes   the   Creditor   money   in   a   
specified  amount  in  order  to  receive a    lump-sum 
distribution  or  regular  payments  from  the  assets  of  
the bankruptcy estate. (11 USC §   502; FRBP 3001(a)). 
2. Chapter  13 
a. Timing 
The deadline for LCSAs to file a proof of claim is 
180  days  after  the  bankruptcy  petition  is  filed.  
(FRBP 3002(c)(1)) 
 NOTE:  If  a  Creditor  misses  the  deadline,  the  
Debtor  or  Trustee  could  file  a  proof  of  claim  on  
behalf  of  the  Creditor  within  30  days  of  the  
Creditor’s deadline. (FRBP 3004). Also, it may be 
possible for the Debtor to file an amended plan to 
provide for the payment on a late proof of claim. 
b. Where to File 
All  claims  must  be  filed  with  the  clerk  in  the  
federal bankruptcy district where the bankruptcy 
case  is  pending.  (FRBP 5005(a)(1))  California  has  
four   bankruptcy   districts:   Northern,   Eastern,   
Central, and Southern. 
c. Documentation 
The proof of claim must include the total amount 
of  the  DSO,  including  all  arrears  owed  by  the  
obligor  for  every  case  open  with  the  support',

agency,  all  costs,  and  interest  as  of  the  date  the  
bankruptcy  petition  is  filed.  (11  USC  §  501, 11 
USC  §  502,  and  11  USC  §  1305;  see  also  FRBP  
3001) 
d. Priority of Claim 
DSO claims should be filed as priority unsecured 
claims pursuant to 11  USC  §  507(a)(1)(A)  and 11 
USC §   507(a)(1)(B). If the LCSA has a   lien filed and 
the  Debtor  actually  owns  real  property  in  the  
same  county,  the  claim  may  be  a  secured  one  to  
the extent that there is equity in the property. 
e. Failure to  File 
A failure to file a proof of   claim does not discharge 
the debt, but it makes it less likely that assets will 
be  secured  to  satisfy  a  support  obligation.  It  also  
makes it  less  likely  that  any  arrears  owed  by  the 
Debtor will be satisfied within the duration of the 
bankruptcy. A Creditor must file a claim with the 
bankruptcy  court  to  receive  payment  from  any  
assets   administered   by   the   Trustee   from   the   
bankruptcy estate. (In re Bateman (11th Cir. 2003) 
331 F.3d 821). Failure to file a   claim means that the 
Creditor   will   receive   no   payments   from   the   
Trustee. (FRBP 3002(a)).
 
 PRACTICE POINT:  A  proof  of claim should  be  filed 
to  make  sure  that  the  bankruptcy  Trustee  is  aware  of 
the   claim   and   to   ensure   payments   throughout   the   
bankruptcy.  If  an  obligor  has  more  than  one  case,  the  
LCSA  should file  a  proof  of  claim  in  each case. 
3. Chapter  7 
The  filing  of  a  proof  of  claim  is  rarely  required  in  a  
Chapter  7  bankruptcy.  A  Chapter  7  liquidation  is  
usually  open  and  closed  in  a  relatively  short  period  
of  time,  and  many  Chapter  7  cases  are  “no  asset”  
cases.  The  Debtor’s  earnings  and  property  acquired  
post-petition  are  not  property  of  the  estate  in  a  
Chapter  7,  and  you  can  continue  to  collect  both  
current  support  and  arrears  payments  through  an  
IWO,   thus   minimizing   the   brief   impact   of   the   
bankruptcy   filing.   (11   USC   §   362(b)(2)(B)).   You',

should,  however,  remain  cognizant  of  the  issues  
surrounding the automatic stay, as discussed above. 
I. OBJECTION TO CLAIM BY DEBTOR  
1. Objection 
A  Debtor  may  file  an  objection  to  a  support  claim  
pursuant to FRBP 3007 and FRBP 9014. 
a. Local Rules 
Many   districts   have   local   rules   regarding   
objecting to a   Debtor’s objection to claims. These 
local rules may mandate the deadline by which 
the Creditor must respond and submit evidence 
and/or  memoranda  of    law.  Failure  to  timely 
comply  may  result  in  the  court  granting  the  
Debtor’s requested relief by default. 
2. Exempt 
Generally, a claim for family support is  exempt from 
discharge under 11 USC § 523(a)(5) and it is not one 
of    the    specific    types    of    claims    which    will    
automatically be disallowed under 11 USC § 502. 
3. Grounds 
Grounds for claim disallowance are listed in 11 USC 
§  502.  The  most  common  objections  to  a  support  
claim are either that the claim amount is incorrect, or 
that the claim was not timely filed. 
a. Determination of Arrears 
If  the  arrears  have  already  been  determined  in  
state  court,  the  federal  court  lacks  jurisdiction  to  
hear a collateral attack on a state court judgment. 
(Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Company (1923) 263 U.S. 
413; District  of  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  v.  
Feldman (1983) 460 U.S. 462; In re Diaz (11th Cir. 
2011), 647  F.3d  1073,  1093)  An  aggrieved  litigant  
must   pursue   his   remedies   through   the   state   
appellate  process,  not  through  inferior  federal  
courts. (GASH Associates v. Village of Rosemont, 
Ill. (7th Cir. 1993) 995 F.2d 726; In re Keeler (D.Md. 
2002) 273 B.R. 416) If the arrears have not already 
been  determined  in  state  court,  the  federal  court  
could  determine  the  support  arrears,  but  many  
bankruptcy judges and attorneys prefer to defer to',

J. DISCHARGEABILITY OF SUPPORT DEBTS AND 
INTEREST ACCRUAL 
the state court to litigate the matter. 
4. Cause 
A claim that has been allowed or disallowed may be 
reconsidered for cause under 11 USC §   502(j).  Cause 
is not defined statutorily, but the statute does provide 
for the allowance or disallowance of   the reconsidered 
claim “according to the equities of the case.” 
1. Discharge 
Support debts, whether assigned or unassigned, are 
not    dischargeable    under    any    chapter    of    the    
Bankruptcy Code. (11 USC § 523(a)(5); Florida Dept. 
of Revenue v. Diaz (11th Cir. 2011) 647 F.3d 1073; In 
re Davis (11th Cir. 2012) 481 Fed. Appx. 492) 
2. Interest 
The  filing  of  a  petition  in  bankruptcy  does  not  stop  
the accrual of   interest on unpaid support debts. (In re 
Foster  (9th  Cir.  2003) 319  F.3d  495; In  re  Witaschek  
(Bankr.
    N.D.    Okla.    2002)    276    B.R.    668) 
Nondischargeable   debts   do   not   cease   accruing   
interest simply because the Debtor has filed a   petition 
in bankruptcy since “interest is considered to be the 
cost of the use of the amounts owing a creditor and 
an  incentive  to  prompt  repayment  and,  thus,  an  
integral   part   of   a   continuing   debt.”   (Bruning  v.  
United States (1964) 376 U.S. 358, 360)',

XIII. INTERJURISDICTIONAL  CASES  
A. UIFSA AND FFCCSOA BASICS  
1. Uniform Interstate Family Support Act 
(UIFSA) 
The UIFSA provides universal and uniform rules for 
the  enforcement  of  family  support  orders.  UIFSA  
2008  became  effective  in  California  on  January  1,  
2016,   repealing   all   previously   chaptered   UIFSA   
provisions. UIFSA 2008 provisions are located at 
FC 
§  5700.101  et  seq
. Sections  are  numbered  to  match  
UIFSA    2008    provisions    (i.e.    
FC    §    5700.319 
corresponds with 
UIFSA § 319). 
 
 PRACTICE    POINT:    On    September    19,    2014, 
President Obama signed the Preventing Sex 
Trafficking   and Strengthening Families   Act   (Public 
Law  113-183),  which  required  all  states  to  enact  the  
2008  version  of  UIFSA,  verbatim,  by  the  end  of  their  
2015  legislative  session  as  a  condition  for  continued  
receipt  of  federal  funds  supporting  state  child  support  
programs.   UIFSA   2008   incorporated   changes   that   
allowed  the  United  States  to  ratify  the  2007  Hague  
Convention   on   the   International   Recovery   of   Child   
Support   and   Other   Forms   of   Family   Maintenance   
(Convention)  for  international  cases,  which  went  into  
effect  for  the  United  States  on  January  1,  2017,  as  
discussed below. 
a. Jurisdiction 
UIFSA  ensures  that  in  every  case  only  one  state  
has  jurisdiction  over  support  at  any  given  time.  
(IRMO    Crosby    and    Grooms    (2004)    116 
Cal.App.4
th
 201, 206). 
b. Types of Orders 
UIFSA   encompasses   any   judgment,    decree,    
order, decision, or directive, whether temporary 
or  final,  or  subject  to  modification,  issued  in  a  
state or foreign country for the benefit of a   child, 
a   spouse, or   a former spouse providing monetary 
support,   health   care,   arrearages,   retroactive   
support, or reimbursement. (
FC § 5700.102(28)).',

c. Record 
In  the  UIFSA  section,  “record”  is  defined  as  
“information   that   is   inscribed   on   a   tangible   
medium or   that is stored in an electronic or other 
medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.” 
(
FC   §   5700.102(20))    This    means    informal    
documents (i.e., text messages or   emails) may be 
submitted to the court for some purposes. 
2. Full  Faith  and  Credit  for  Child  Support  Orders  
Act (FFCCSOA) 
This federal law (
28 USC § 1738B) was enacted and 
became effective on October 20, 1994 and amended in 
1996,  1997,  and  2014.  The  law  requires  States  to  
enforce  child  support  orders  made  by  other  States  
and  prohibits  States  from  modifying  other  States’  
child support orders unless it has subject matter and 
personal  jurisdiction  and  the  parties  were  given  
notice and an opportunity to be heard. 
3. Interstate  Recognition  and  Enforcement 
Sister  state  support  orders  rendered  by  a  court  of  
competent   jurisdiction   in   compliance   with   the   
FFCCSOA/UIFSA  must  be  recognized  and  enforced  
across   state   lines.   (
28   USC   §   1738B(a);   FC   §   
5700.205(c), FC § 5700.207(a), FC § 5700.603(c)). 
Therefore,  any  initial  child  support  orders  issued  
after  October  20,  1994  must  be  analyzed  with  the  
concept of   Continuing Exclusive Jurisdiction (CEJ) in 
mind. (See Section G, infra). 
4. State         IV-D         Agency         Services         in         
Intergovernmental Cases 
Federal  Regulation  (
45  CFR  §  303.7)  requires  that  
State IV-D Agencies provide intergovernmental IV-D 
services upon request and enumerates the Initiating 
State  agency’s  responsibilities  (
45  CFR  §  303.7(c)) 
and  Responding  State  agency’s  responsibilities.  (
45 
CFR    §    303.7(d)

enforcement,    and review    and adjustment.    In    
addition, Agencies must cooperate with requests for 
the  following  limited  services:  quick  locate,  service  
of  process,  assistance  with  discovery  and  genetic  
testing,   teleconferenced   hearings,   administrative   
reviews,    high-volume   automated   administrative   
enforcement,  copies  of  court  orders,  and  payment  
records.  Requests  for  other  limited  services  may  be  
honored    at    the    State’s    option (i.e. probate 
proceedings  in  another  state,  real  estate  liens,  or  
bank   levies).   The   services   described   above   also   
includes     Direct     Applications     received     from     
International Residents. (454 (4)(A) (ii) of the Social 
Security Act [42 U.S.C. 654] and PIQ-99-01, Federal 
Office of Child Support Enforcement). 
B. CHOICE OF LAW ISSUES  
1. Issuing  State’s  Law 
The  issuing  state’s  law  governs  the  “nature,  extent,  
amount,  and  duration  of  current  payments”  to  be  
enforced  under  an  existing  order,  as  well  as  the  
computation and payment of arrearages and accrual 
of  interest  thereon.  (
FC  §  5700.604(a);  28  USC  §  
1738B(h)).  Note  that  the  interest  rate  of  the  issuing  
state   applies   until   the   order   is   registered   and   
modified by another state having CEJ. 
 
 PRATICE  POINT:  The  interest  on  arrears  accrues  
pursuant  to  the  law  of  the  state  that  contributed  the  
arrears  unless  and  until  the  order  is  modified.  If  a  new  
state  assumes  CEJ  and  modifies  the  order,  the  interest  
then   accrues   pursuant   to   the   new   state’s   laws. 
Therefore,  the  calculation  of  interest  on  arrears  can  be  
complicated,    requiring    different    interest    rates    for 
different time periods. 
2. Statute  of  Limitations  (SOL)  on  Enforcement  of  
Arrears 
For  arrears,  the  forum  court  must  apply  the  SOL  of  
its’  state  or  the  issuing  state  or  foreign  country,  
whichever  is  longer.  (
FC  §  5700.604(b); 28  USC  §  
1738B(h)(3); Bell  v.  Heflin  (2016) 383  P.3d  1031).',

Therefore,     California’s     statute     of     limitations     
ordinarily will always apply in a UIFSA proceeding 
to  enforce  an  out-of  -state  support  order  because,  
under  CA  law,  support  orders  are  enforceable  until  
paid  in  full  or  otherwise  satisfied.  (
FC § 291(a), FC 
§ 4502
; Trend v. Bell (1997) 57 Cal.App.4
th
 1092). 
However, if the statute of   limitations for collection of 
arrears  has  expired  for  an  out-of  -state  order,  a  CA  
court  cannot  revive  the  order  by  registering  and  
enforcing  it.  (See Scheuerman  v.  Hauk  (2004)  116 
Cal.App.4
th
   1140   [AZ   statute   of   limitations   for   
recovery   of   arrears   was   3   years   after   the   child   
emancipates;  after  the  SOL  expired  and  the  order  
could  not  be  enforced  in  AZ,  Mother  could  not  
register the order in CA to recover arrears]). 
3. Forum  State’s  Law 
The    procedural    and    substantive    law    of    the    
responding   state   applies   in   all   other   respects,   
including  determining  the  duty  of  support  and  the  
payable  guideline  amount.  (
FC § 5700.303; 28 USC 
§  1738B(h
); see IRMO  Crosby  and  Grooms  (2004)

jurisdiction under UIFSA, CA law governs amount of

C. PROCEDURAL RULES  
1. Case  Initiation 
Pursuant  to 
FC  §  5700.301(b),    an  individual  or

forwarding to a responding tribunal; or 
b. filing   a   petition   or   comparable   pleading   
directly  in  the  tribunal  of  another  state  or  a  
foreign country that has or can obtain personal 
jurisdiction over the respondent.',

3. Federally  Mandated  Forms 
UIFSA    proceedings    must    be    prosecuted    and    
defended     using     federally     mandated     forms,     
promulgated by the Federal Office of Child Support 
Services. (

information,  that  information  must  be  sealed  and  
may not be disclosed to the other party or the public. 
After   a   hearing   in   which   a   tribunal   takes   into   
consideration the health, safety, or   liberty of   the party 
or   child,   the   tribunal   may   order   disclosure   of   
information that the tribunal determines to be in the 
interest  of  justice.”  UIFSA  2008  forms  include  the  
Child   Support   Agency   Confidential   Information   
Form  (OMB  0970-0085)  for  use  by  the  IV-D  agency  
only and is not to be filed with a   tribunal or   provided 
to  the  other  party.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Personal  
Information Form for 
UIFSA § 311 (OMB 0970-0085) 
is  filed  with  the  tribunal,  along  with  the  petition.  
Although this form is not filed in a public access file, 
it may be disclosed to the parties in the case, unless 
accompanied   by   an   Affidavit   of   non-Disclosure 
(DCSS 0722). 
 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   An   ex   parte   order   for   non- 
disclosure  is  no  longer  required  as  of  January  1,  2015.  
The  Judicial  Council  made  obsolete  the  FL-511  form,  
utilized  for  that  purpose,  as  of  January  1,  2017;  UIFSA  
2008   codified   the   statutory   change   from   judicial   to   
administrative   process   as   of   January   1,   2016.   The 
party  only  must  allege in  an affidavit  or  a  pleading 
under  oath  that  the  health,  safety,  or  liberty  of  a  party  
would be jeopardized by disclosure.

a. Out-of-State Order, NCP in  Issuing State 
If  a  CA  LCSA  wants  to  enforce  an  out-of  -state 
order and the NCP is still in the state that issued 
the  order,  the  LCSA  must  initiate  a  two-state 
case with the issuing state to enforce.

issuing state must grant the request by issuing a 
conforming IWO or an administrative notice of 
change   of   payee   to   the   employer.   In   this   
situation, CA LCSA becomes the new custodian 
of   records.   The   LCSA   may   also   consider   
modification of   the order, where appropriate, as 
the new order is made payable to the state that 
issued the order. 
 
1. Appearance 
Petitioner’s physical presence is not required in the 
forum court. (
FC § 5700.316(a)). Also, a nonresident 
petitioner’s   participation   in   UIFSA proceedings 
before  the responding   tribunal   does   not   confer 
personal  jurisdiction  over  petitioner  in  any  other 
proceeding; and the person is not amenable to service 
of     process   while   physically present   in   CA   to 
participate in a UIFSA proceeding. (
FC § 5700.314). 
Telephone appearances  shall  be   permitted  by 
nonresident parties or witnesses. (
FC § 5700.316(f)) 
Appearances by telephone must also be permitted in 
any child support action when the LCSA is providing 
services,  even  if  both  parents  reside  in  CA.  (
FC § 
17404.3). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Prior  to  UIFSA  2008,  the  statute  
stated  the  court  “may”  permit  a  nonresident  party  or  
witness  to  testify  by  telephone.  Now,  the  statute  states  
the  court  “shall”  permit  telephonic  appearances.  This  
may  result  in  significant  changes,  as  many  courts  do 
not     allow     telephonic     appearances     in     contempt     
proceedings.

 NOTE:   To   be   admissible   in   a   CA   court,

3. Certified  Payment  Record 
A certified record of payments may be forwarded to 
the  forum  court  and  used  as  evidence  of  the  facts  
asserted  therein  and  is  admissible  to  show  whether  
payments were made. (
FC § 5700.316(c)). 
4. Means of Transmission 
Documents  transmitted  from  another  state  to  the  
forum  court  by  telephone,  fax,  or  email  are  not  
excludable  from  evidence  upon  objection  based  on  
the means of transmission. (
FC § 5700.316(e)). 
5. Privileges 
If   a   party   invokes   the   privilege   against   self- 
incrimination to refuse to testify at a UIFSA hearing, 
the trier of   fact “may draw an adverse inference from 
the  refusal.”  (
FC  §  5700.316(g)).  Spousal  privilege  
does   not   apply   in   UIFSA   proceedings.   (FC   §   
5700.316(h)).  The  defense  of  immunity  based  on  
husband-wife  or  parent-child  relationships  do  not  
apply.(
FC § 5700.316(i)). 
6. Financial 
Amounts   collected   in   a   different   state   shall   be   
credited against the accounts for a CA child support 
order for the same period. (FC § 5700.209) Amounts 
received must be disbursed promptly and the LCSA 
shall  furnish  a  requesting  party  or  court  of  another  
state    a    certified    payment    statement.    (

7. Enforcement of  Multiple  Orders 
In   responding   to   registrations   or   petitions   for   
enforcement of two or more child support orders in 
effect  at  the  same  time  against  the  same  obligor  but  
with  respect  to  different  obligees,  at  least  one  of  
which  was  issued  by  a  tribunal  in  another  state  or  
country, a   CA court “shall enforce those orders in the 
same  manner  as  if  the  orders  had  been  issued  by  a  
tribunal of this state.” (
FC § 5700.208). 
8. Attorney  Fees  and  Costs 
UIFSA petitioners may not be required to pay a   filing 
fee  or  other  costs.  (
FC § 5700.313(a)).  A  prevailing  
obligee   in   UIFSA   proceedings   may   be   awarded   
“filing fees, reasonable attorney fees, other costs, and 
necessary   travel   and   other   reasonable   expenses   
incurred by the obligee and the obligee’s witnesses.” 
(
FC  §  5700.313(b)).  Neither  the  obligee  nor  the  
initiating or responding state’s support enforcement 
agency may be assessed fees, costs or   expenses by the 
court “except  as  provided  by  other  law.”  (
FC  §  
5700.313(b)). 
Costs and reasonable attorney fees shall be ordered if 
the court determines a  UIFSA hearing was requested 
“primarily   for   delay.”   A   party   who   requests   a   
hearing to contest the registration of   a   support order 
is presumed to have done so “primarily for delay” if 
the  order  is  confirmed  or  enforced  without  change.  
(
FC § 5700.313(c)).

e. Types of Requests for Evidence Abroad 
1) Information    Regarding    the    Laws    of    
Foreign  Countries  in  the  Establishment  of  
Parentage of Children Born out of Wedlock: 
When  addressing  UIFSA  cases  from  foreign  
countries, there might be situations in which a 
parent’s  name  and  signature  appears  on  a  
child’s  birth  certificate.  In  this  situation,  it  is  
important for the LCSA to verify if a parent’s 
name and   signature   on   the   child’s   birth   
certificate   is   evidence   that   paternity   has   
already  been  established  under  the  foreign 
country''s   laws.    Verifying   this   information 
will assist an LCSA to determine if parentage 
is   at   issue   and   whether   to   proceed   with 
establishment of   parentage   under 
FC   § 
5700.305(b)1
,  and FC § 5700.402.',

Similarly,   this   information   will   assist   the   
Court and the LCSA in determining if a non- 
parentage   argument   can   be   considered   a   
defense under 
FC § 5700.315. 
 
 PRACTICE POINT: In working incoming cases from 
Mexican states,  an LCSA  can request  the  Mexican 
Consulate in  their  jurisdiction issue  a  “Certificate  of 
Mexican Law.” This document describes how paternity 
is  established according to  the laws  of  the  applicable 
Mexican state. To verify  if  other countries  issue these 
documents, the LCSA must contact that specific 
Embassy or Consulate. For  information  regarding 
specific  Embassies  or  Consulates,  please refer to the 
U.S. Department of State website: 
https://www.usembassy.gov. 
2) Information Regarding the Legal Effect of a 
Judgment,   Decree,    or   Order   Entered   by   a   
Foreign Tribunal: 
In UIFSA cases, specifically in border states, it is 
common that after an NCP has been served with 
the    Summons    and    Complaint    Regarding    
Parental  Obligations  (S&C)  by  the  LCSA,  the  
NCP  then  provides  documentation  regarding  
legal  proceedings  taking  place  in  the  child’s  
home state (usually regarding issues of   custody, 
visitation,   child   support   agreements,   and/or   
voluntary  consignments  of  child  support,  etc.).  
In     these     situations     (where     simultaneous     
proceedings arise), an LCSA can assist the court 
in    determining    the    proper    jurisdiction    to    
establish a   judgment under 
FC §   5700.204, thus 
avoiding duplicate judgments. 
 
 PRACTICE    POINT:    Under    FC  §  3951(a)-(c), 
Voluntary child support payments are considered gifts. 
In dealing with cases with Mexico, it is common that 
after an NCP is served with the S&C, the NCP obligor 
proceeds to file a similar action in Mexico, and/or 
provides receipts of voluntary child support payments 
or consignments made before the court in Mexico (not 
considered court-ordered child support judgments 
under Mexican law), and agreements of child support',

executed   between   the   parties   before   the   District   
Attorney’s  office  (not  before  the  Courts,  and  merely  
executed  in  good  faith)  with  the  intention  of  challenging  
the  jurisdiction  of  the  CA  courts,  claiming  that  a  child  
support  order  is  already  entered  in  Mexico,  and  that  to  
proceed  with  a  CA  judgment  would  create  a  duplicate  
judgment.  In  these  situations,  the  LCSA  needs  to  verify  
the  nature  of  the  proceeding  that  is  taking  place  in  the  
Mexican  courts  to  assist  the  CA  Courts  in  determining  
proper   jurisdiction   to   hear   the   case   and   enter   a 
judgment. 
 
3) Status of a Proceeding in Foreign Country: 
An LCSA might find itself in a situation where 
the parties have filed a legal action at the same 
time.   For   example,   the   LCSA   might   file   a   
UIFSA    Summons    &    Petition    seeking    to    
establish parentage   and   child   support   on   
behalf  of  the  CP  in  the  CA  courts,  and  on  the  
other  hand,  the  NCP  may  file  for  divorce,  
and/or   establishment   of   parentage,   custody   
and visitation in the foreign country. 
The purpose of the “Letter of Request to Obtain 
Evidence  Abroad”  is  to  learn  the  status  of  the  
legal  proceedings  filed  in  the  foreign  country  
by   the   NCP.   The   information   most   often   
requested  and  that  should  be  included  in  the  
body of the Hague forms is the following: 
 The nature of the legal action (divorce, 
parentage, custody, visitation, or support 
(filed  by  the  NCP  in  the  family  courts  of  
the foreign country; 
 If the CP has already been served with 
a copy of the said summons, and if so, the 
date  of  service  (This  point  of  clarification  
is  extremely  helpful  in  the  “race  to  the  
courthouse” argument.); 
 If   a   judgment,   order,    or   decree   of   
dissolution      of      marriage,      paternity,      
custody,   and  visitation  has  already  been

  If  a temporary  or final judgment  of 
child support has been entered. 
Once received, the information from the foreign 
court  will  allow  the  LCSA  to  take  the  best  
course of action, particularly in cases where it is 
discovered  that  child  support  has  not  been  
addressed  in  the  action  that  was  filed  in  the  
courts of the foreign country, which then gives 
the CA courts adequate jurisdiction to proceed 
with the establishment of a child support order. 
 
 PRACTICE     POINT:     If     the     LCSA     receives     
information from  the foreign court  that  child  support 
has  in  fact  been  established  (or  has  been  requested  by  
the  NCP)  in  the  foreign  court  proceeding,  and  that  
country  is  also  the  child’s  home  state,  an  NCP  will  only  
be  successful  in  challenging  California’s  jurisdiction  to  
establish  a child  support  order  if  the NCP  follows  all 
the procedures  established  in FC  §  5700.204(b)(1).

Under 
EC § 452(f), the law of an organization 
of nations  and  of foreign  nations  and  public 
entities  in  foreign  nations  is  subject  to  judicial  
notice. 
5) Means of    Transmission    of    “Letters    of 
Request to Obtain Evidence Abroad”: 
The channels of transmission authorized by the 
Hague  Convention  on  the  Taking  of  Evidence  
Abroad are the following: 
 Central Authority (Article 2): In the case 
of  the  United  States  it  is  the  United  States

1. After Pleading  Filed  in  Another  State 
CA  court  may  exercise  jurisdiction  to  “establish”  
support if the petition is filed after a   pleading is filed 
out-of  -state  or  country  only  if  all  of  the  following  
circumstances exist (
FC § 5700.204(a)): 
a. A   petition   was filed   in   CA   before   the 
expiration  of  the  time  allowed  in  the  other  
state or country to file a responsive pleading; 
b. The  contesting  party  timely  challenges  the  
other state’s or country’s jurisdiction; and 
c. “If relevant,” CA is the child’s “home state.” 
1) “Home state” 
The  state  or  foreign  country  where  the  child  
lived with a parent for at least six consecutive 
months  immediately  preceding  filing  of  a  
petition for support; or, if the child is less than 
six months old, the state where the child lived 
from  birth.  (
FC  §  5700.102(8); 28  USC  §  
1738B(b)
). 
2. Before  Pleading  Filed  in   Another  State 
A CA court may not exercise jurisdiction to establish 
support  if  the  petition  is  filed  before  a  pleading  is  
filed  in  another  state  or  country  where  all  of  the  
following circumstances exist (
FC § 5700.204(b)): 
a. The  pleading  was  filed  in  the  other  state  or  
country   before   the expiration   of   the   time   
allowed in CA to file a responsive pleading; 
b. The  contesting  party  timely  challenges  the  
exercise of CA jurisdiction; and 
c. “If  relevant,”  the  other  state  or  country  is  the  
child’s “home state.” 
3. No Pleading  in the Home State 
If no pleading has been filed in the child’s home state,

support  jurisdiction.  (IRMO  Richardson  (2009)  179

G. JURISDICTIONAL CONFLICTS  
1. Spousal  Support 
The   state   that   orders   spousal   support   retains   
continuing,  exclusive  jurisdiction  to  modify  spousal  
support  throughout  the  existence  of  the  support  
obligation; CA jurisdiction concerning an out-of  -state 
spousal  support  order  is  limited  to  enforcing  the  
order according to its terms. (
FC § 5700.211; Lundahl 
v. Telford (2004) 116 Cal.App.4
th
 305; IRMO Rassier 
(2002) 96 Cal.App.4
th
 1431). 
2. Child  Support 
Courts  must  defer  to  the  state  with  Continuing  
Exclusive Jurisdiction (CEJ) to modify child support. 
(
FC § 5700.205; 28 USC § 1738B(d)-(e)). 
a. First State to  Issue Order 
The first state to issue a   valid child support order 
has  CEJ  as  long  as  the obligor,  oblige,  or  child 
resides in  that  state  at  the  time  the  request  for  
modification  is  filed.  (See Kilroy  v.  Super.  Ct. 
(1997) 54 Cal.App.4
th
 793 [CA court did not have 
jurisdiction   because   Mother   and   child   still   
resided  in  Georgia,  which  was  the  state  that  
issued  the registered order.  Further,  the court 
found  FFCCSOA  to  be  a  valid  regulation  of  
interstate commerce under the commerce clause, 
that  it  did  not  violate  the  10th  Amendment  of  
the U.S. Constitution.]). 
 
 PRACTICE POINT: UIFSA  2008  clarifies  this  point 
to  say  that  even if  all     parties  left  the issuing  state  at 
one point  if  one party  resides  in  the  issuing  state  at 
the time the  request  for  modification  is  filed  and no 
other  state  has  assumed  CEJ,  the  issuing  state  retains  
jurisdiction. (FC § 5700.205(a)(1)).',

to  remain.  A  person  stationed  in  CA  in  
the  military  does  not  reside  in  CA  for  
purposes  of  UIFSA  because  “residence”  
must    mean    “domicile”,    or    “military    
domicile”.  (But  see  comment  following  
UIFSA   (2008)   §   205   [stating    “the    
question   is   residence,   not   domicile,”

the two terms]).

  969 –    Mexico  no  longer  had  
CEJ   because   Rebollo   did   not   have   a

on whether a  party’s “residence” is  in the 
issuing  state  (not  whether  the  party’s  
“domicile” is there). 
2) Orders Entitled to CEJ Status 
Any  type  of  child  support  order  is  entitled  to  
CEJ status, including: 
 An  order  staying  a  support  obligation  
based on the financial resources and needs 
of both parents (Rivera v. Ramsey County 
(2000)  615  N.W.2d  854  [noting,  however,',

that  an  order  reserving  over  the  issue  of  
child support is not, itself, a child support 
order]); 
 An order providing for health insurance 
or   medical   support   only   (Bordelon   v.   
Dehnert  (2000) 770  So.2d  433; Watkins  v. 
Watkins (2001) 802 So.2d 145); and 
 An order for monetary support, arrears, 
retroactive  support,  or  reimbursement  for  
financial     assistance     provided     to     an     
individual obligee. (
FC § 5700.102(28)). 
 A  temporary  support  order  issued  ex  
parte,     or     pending     resolution     of     a     
jurisdictional conflict does not create CEJ in 
the issuing tribunal. (
FC § 5700.205(e)). 
3) Losing CEJ 
By negative implication, a CA court that issued 
a  child  support  order  does  not  have  CEJ  to  
modify the order when all of   the parties and the 
child  reside  out-of  -state,  even  if  no  other  state  
has assumed jurisdiction over the case. (IRMO 
Haugh (2014) 225 Cal.App.4
th
 963). 
3. Jurisdiction  to  Modify 
A CA court can obtain jurisdiction to modify another 
state’s child support order when: 
a. All Parties Now in CA 
All individual parties presently reside in CA and 
the child no longer resides in the issuing state; (
FC 
§ 5700.613(a)). 
b. Consent 
CA is the residence of the child, or, an individual 
party is subject to CA personal jurisdiction, and all 
of   the   individual   parties   have   filed   or   given   
consent  in  a  record  in  the  issuing  court  for  a  CA  
court to modify the order and assume CEJ; (

effective even if signed only by parties’ attorneys. 
(Knabe v. Brister (2007) 154 Cal.App.4
th
 1316). 
c. The “Play Away” Rule 
A CA court finds, after notice and hearing, all the 
following (
FC § 5700.611(a)(1)): 
1) The child, individual obligee and obligor do 
not reside in the issuing state, 
2) A  nonresident  party  has  petitioned  the CA 
court for a modification, and 
3) The respondent  is  subject  to  CA  personal 
jurisdiction. 
In  other  words,  the  person  seeking  modification  
must   “play   away.”   (See IRMO   Crosby   and   
Grooms (2004) 116 Cal.App.4
th
 201). 
4. Exceptions  to  the  “Play Away”  Rule 
UIFSA  2008  includes  three  exceptions  to  the  “play  
away”  rule  to  allow  the  parties  to  agree  to  a  forum  
asserting  CEJ  and  ensure  that  parties  are  not  left  
without a forum in which to seek a modification. 
a. Consent 
Parties can consent to a state retaining CEJ even if 
no  party  lives  there,  or  parties  can  consent  to  
another  state  assuming  CEJ,  even  if  someone  
remains issuing. 
1) State Retaining CEJ 
If  CA  has  issued  a  child  support  order,  but  
none  of  the  parties  reside  in  CA,  the  parties  
may consent to a   CA court retaining CEJ. (
FC 
§ 5700.205(a)(2)). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  The  statute  states  parties  must  
consent  “in  a  record  or  in  open  court.”  Therefore,  the  
consent  must  be  in  writing  or  the parties  must  appear 
in court to consent.',

 NOTE: FC   §   5700.102(20)   defines   “record”   as   
information  that  is  inscribed  on  a  tangible  medium  or 
that  is  stored  in  an  electronic  or  other  medium  and  is  
retrievable  in  perceivable  form.  A  record  can  thus  be  a  
formal written document, text message, or email. 
 
2) Another State Assumes CEJ 
Even  if  CA  has  CEJ,  parties  can  “file  consent  
in a record” with a CA court to have another 
state’s  tribunal  assume  CEJ  and  modify  the  
order (so  long  as  the child  resides  in  that 
state, or the tribunal has personal jurisdiction 
over      one of   the parties). (
FC § 
5700.205(b)(1) [the  consent  is  filed  in  the 
issuing  state];  and 
FC  §  5700.611(a)(2)  [the 
state  assuming  CEJ  finds  that  consent  was  
filed in the issuing state]). 
b. International Move Away 
A CA court retains jurisdiction to modify its order 
if: 1. one party resides in another state as defined 
by  UIFSA,  and  2.  the  other  party  resides  outside  
the U.S. (
FC § 5700.611(f)). This is to ensure that 
the parties are not left without a forum to modify 
the order due to the “play-away” rule. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Note  that  CA  is  not  the  only  
jurisdiction that may modify under these 
circumstances.  If  the  requesting  party  is  in  the  U.S.,  he 
or  she may  choose to  play  away  to  the other  country. 
If  the  requesting  party  is  outside the U.S.,  he  or  she 
may   register   and   request   modification   in   the   U.S.   
resident’s  new  state.  The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  
ensure that the party remaining in the U.S. is not forced 
to  litigate  support  issues  in  an international  forum. 
c. Modification of Foreign Support Order 
A  CA  court  with  personal  jurisdiction  over  the  
parties  can  modify  a  foreign  support  order  if  the  
foreign   country   lacks   or   refuses   to   exercise   
jurisdiction  to  modify  its  order  pursuant  to  its  
laws.  (

obligor is not necessary.',

FL-590A,  UIFSA  Child  Support  Order  Jurisdictional  
Attachment,  must  be  attached  to  court  orders  when  
the court must make a finding regarding CEJ. 
6. Loss of CEJ 
The state that issued the original child support order 
loses  its  CEJ  over  the  order  once  another  state  with  
FFCCSOA/UIFSA jurisdiction modifies the order. At 
that point, the modifying state becomes the state with 
CEJ.  (
FC  §  5700.205(c), FC  §  5700.611(e),  and  28 
USC § 1738B(d)). 
a. Limitation 
Following the shift in CEJ, the issuing state shall 
recognize the modifying order of   the other state, 
upon   registration,   for   enforcement,   and   is   
limited to: 
1) Enforcing   its   order   as   to   arrears   and   
interest   accruing   before   the   modification;   
and 
2) Providing  other  “appropriate  relief”  for  a  
violation of its order that occurred before the 
modification.  (
FC  §  5700.612;  28  USC  §  
1738B(g)). 
 
H. MULTIPLE ORDER ISSUES  
1. Rules of Priority 
Under UIFSA and FFCCSOA, there is  only one valid 
support   order   regarding   the   same   parties   and   
children.  However,  because  there  could  be  multiple  
conflicting   orders   under   prior   laws,   there   is   a   
procedure to determine which of   several orders is the 
controlling  order.  (
FC  §  5700.207(b); 28  USC  §  
1738B(f)).  This  applies  only  to  orders  with  ongoing  
support  that  were  issued  prior  to  the  enactment  of  
FFCCSOA on October 20, 1994. After FFCCSOA was 
enacted, if one state has entered an order and a   party',

continues  to  reside  in  that  state,  any  subsequent  
orders issued in other states are void ab initio for lack

330  P.3d  471; State  ex  rel.  Freeman  v.  Sadlier  (1998)  
586 N.W.2d 171). 
 
 PRACTICE     POINT: Because     the     multiple 
conflicting   orders   must   have   been   issued   before 
October  20,  1994, with  continuing  support  to  have  a  
situation  requiring  a  determination  of  controlling  order,  
these  are  extremely  rare  at  this  point.  If  the  children 
have  all  been emancipated,  the  proper  request  is  for  a  
determination of arrears. 
2. Determining  Controlling  Order  (DCO)  (FC  §  
5700.207(b)): 
 NOTE: Determining  Controlling  Order  (DCO)  
(
FC  §  5700.207(b)):  A  DCO  is  necessary  if  all  the  
orders    were    issued    before    FFCCSOA    became    
effective  (10/20/1994)  and  at  least  one  child  has  not  
emancipated. 
a. Only One Court with CEJ 
If  only  one  of  the  courts  would  have  CEJ  under  
the FFCCSOA/UIFSA, that court’s order controls 
and must be recognized. 
b. More   Than   One   State   CEJ—Home   State   
Preference 
If  more  than  one  of  the  courts  would  have  CEJ  
under the FFCCSOA/UIFSA, an order issued by 
a   court of   the child’s current home state controls. 
But  if  no  order is issued  by  the child’s  current 
home   state,   the   most   recently   issued   order   
controls. 
c. No State With CEJ—CA Jurisdiction to Enter 
Controlling Order 
If  none  of  the  courts  would  have  CEJ  under  the  
FFCCSOA/UIFSA,  a  CA  court  with  jurisdiction  
over the parties “shall issue a   support order” and 
that  order  is  the  controlling  order  entitled  to  
interstate recognition and enforcement.',

3. Reconciliation  of  Arrears  (ROA) 
If all the orders were issued before FFCCSOA became 
effective  and  all  the  children  were  emancipated,  a  
DCO is not necessary but a ROA is necessary. 
a. A   ROA   will   (1)   determine   the   amount   of   
support that accrued compared to the amount of 
support    paid,    along    with    other    forms    of    
satisfaction of the child support obligation, and 
(2) determine the unpaid balance. 
b. When  calculating  arrears  for  multiple  orders,  
each order is entitled to full faith and credit. All 
payments  are  applied  pro  tanto  (to  each  order).  
Essentially,   arrears   accrue   under   the   highest   
order for any given period. Interest also accrues 
on  each  order  as  directed  by  the  law  of  the  
issuing state. 
4. Validity  of  Order 
a. If you discover there are two or more orders for 
the same parties and children issued by different 
states  post-FFCCSOA  while  one  state  retained  
CEJ, you should first request the state that issued 
the  order  in  violation  of  FFCCSOA  to  set  aside  
their order. If that state won’t set aside its order, 
a request to determine the validity of the orders 
must  be  filed  in  the  state  which  retained  CEJ. 
Attach all the known orders and explain the facts 
regarding     CEJ.     A     copy     of     the     court’s     
determination   regarding   the   validity   of   the   
orders   should   be   sent   to   the   other   state(s)   
involved. 
5. CEJ 
A  “controlling  order”  is  the  only  order  for  current  
support  that  is  prospectively  enforceable.  The  court  
that  issued  the  controlling  order  has  CEJ.  (

I. ENFORCEMENT OF OUT-OF-STATE SUPPORT 
ORDER WITHOUT REGISTRATION 
 
1. Direct  Income  Withholding  Orders  (IWOs) 
Another   state   may   send   an   out-of  -state  IWO  to  
enforce  its  own  order  to  the  obligor''s  CA  employer  
directly  without  first  filing  a  petition  or  registering  
the order in a CA court. (
FC § 5700.501). So long as 
it  “appears  regular  on  its  face,”  the  IWO  must  be  
treated by the employer as if it had been issued by a 
CA court. (
FC § 5700.502(b)). 
 NOTE: Direct  IWOs  are  no  longer  available  to  
foreign  countries  as  they  are  no  longer  part  of  the  
“state” definition. 
a. Contesting IWO Through Registration 
The    obligor    may    contest    the    validity    or    
enforcement  of  the  out-of  -state  IWO  received  by  
the CA employer by registering the order in a CA 
court.  (FC  §  5700.506(a)).  There  usually  is  no  
underlying  case  in  a  CA  court  but  CRC  5.335  
provides  a  uniform  procedure  for  handling  the  
hearing on an interstate IWO. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Likewise,  since  all  states  have  
adopted UIFSA  2008,  if  there is  a  CA  support  order, 
but  the  obligor’s  employer  is  in  another  state,  the  LCSA  
may  issue  an  IWO  directly  to  the  obligor’s  employer.  
Note  that  the  obligor  may  register  the  IWO  in  the  other  
state  to  contest  it.    Be  sure to  respond when given 
notice  of  an obligor’s  registration  and contest  of  the 
IWO  (which  may  require  requesting assistance  from 
the IV-D agency in the other state). 
2. Administrative  Enforcement  through  LCSA 
UIFSA also authorizes administrative enforcement of 
another  state  or  foreign  support  order  through  the  
LCSA, which sidesteps registration of   the order. (
FC 
§   5700.507
) Upon receipt of the documents required 
for  registering  an  order,  the  LCSA,  without  initially  
registering    the    order,    “shall    consider    and,    if    
appropriate,
 use any  administrative    procedure”',
  'ORDER WITHOUT REGISTRATION',
  269
);

authorized  by  CA  law  to  enforce  a  support  order  
and/or IWO. (
FC § 5700.507(b)). If the obligor does 
not  contest  administrative  enforcement,  the  order  
need   not   be   registered,   but   the   order   shall   be   
registered  if  the  obligor  contests  the  validity  or  
administrative   enforcement   of   the   order.   (
FC  §  
5700.507(b)). 
J. ENFORCEMENT   BY   REGISTRAION   WITH   CA   
COURT 
 
1. Registration 
An   out-of  -state   support   order   or   IWO   may   be   
registered  in  CA  for  enforcement.  (FC  §  5700.601). 
This does not make the order a CA order. 
2. Required  Documents 
Registration   of   an   out-of  -state   order   occurs   by   
sending the following documents to the appropriate 
CA court. (
FC § 5700.602(a)): 
a. A  letter  of  transmittal  requesting  registration  
and enforcement; 
b. Two  copies,  including  one  certified  copy  of 
the   order   to   be   registered,   including   any   
modification of the order; 
c. A sworn or   certified statement of   arrears; 
d. Obligor’s   name   and   other   descriptors,   if   
known; 
e. Obligee’s    name    and    address,    except    as    
provided in 
FC § 5700.312. 
 NOTE: The method of certifying an order as a 
true and correct copy varies by other states’ laws. 
With   the   implementation   of   UIFSA   2008   and   
advances  in  technology,  many  states  are  moving  
to electronic certification. 
3. Seeking  Affirmative  Relief

affirmatively  sought  under  other  CA  law  may  be',

filed at the same time as the request for registration 
or later. (
FC § 5700.602(c)). 
4. Enforceable  as  CA  Order 
Once   registered,   the   support   order   or   IWO   is   
enforceable “in the same manner and is subject to the 
same procedures” as an order issued by a CA court. 
(
FC § 5700.603(b)).  However,  the  CA  court  cannot  
modify the registered order if the issuing forum still 
has jurisdiction. (
FC § 5700.603(c)). 
5. Notice  to   “Nonregistering  Party” 
Upon  registration  of  the  out-of  -state  order  or  IWO,  
the CA court “shall notify the nonregistering party.” 
(
FC § 5700.605(a)). For IWOs, the LCSA or CA court 
“shall notify the obligor’s employer” pursuant to CA 
law. (
FC § 5700.605(d)). 
6. “Nonregistering   Party’s”   Right   to   Challenge   
Registered Order 
The  nonregistering  party  may  seek  to  vacate  the  
registration, to assert any defense to an allegation of 
non-compliance,   or   contest   the   remedies   being   
sought  or  the  amount  of  alleged  arrears.  (
FC  §  
5700.606(a)
). 
a. To  contest  the  validity  or  enforcement  of  the  
registered  order,  a  nonregistering  party  must  
request a hearing within 20 days after notice. (
FC 
§       5700.606(a),        referencing        FC       §       
5700.605(b)(2)). JCF FL-575 is used to request 
the   hearing.   Federal   regulations   govern   the   
allowable  timeframes  for  contesting  IWOs.  
(42 
USC § 666(b)
). 
 
 NOTE:   CA   courts   serve   notice   on   the   
nonregistering     party     typically     by     mail.     
Therefore,  the  time  for  service  is  extended.  See

b. Upon the nonregistering party’s timely request 
for  hearing  to  contest  the  registered  order,  the  
CA  court  must  schedule  the  matter  for  hearing  
and give notice to the parties of the date, time and 
place of the hearing. (
FC § 5700.606(c)). 
7. Defenses  to  Registration 
The  contesting  party  has  the  burden  of  proving  one  
of   the eight defenses to registration (FC §   5700.607(a); 
see  also  Willmer  v.  Willmer  (2006)  144 Cal.App.4

motion to vacate registration citing, inter alia, lack of 
personal  jurisdiction;  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed,  
finding that the Obligor “failed to meet his burden of 
proving  that  the  German  court  had  no  jurisdiction  
over  him  under  its  own  laws,  or  that  Germany''s  
assertion of   jurisdiction offends traditional notions of 
fair play and substantial justice.”]): 
a. The court that issued the order lacked personal 
jurisdiction over the obligor; 
b. The order was obtained by fraud; 
c. The  order  has  been  vacated,  suspended,   or 
modified by a later order; 
d. The  issuing  court  stayed  the  order  pending  
appeal; 
e. There is a defense under CA law to the remedy 
sought  (e.g.,  violation  of  due  process  or  lack  of  
subject matter jurisdiction); 
f. Full or partial payment has been made; 
g. Arrearages  enforcement  is  precluded  by  the  
applicable SOL; or 
h. The   alleged   controlling   order   is   not   the   
controlling order. 
 NOTE:   Non-parentage   is   not   a   defense   to   
registration. (

challenge the registration of a foreign order]). 
8. Disposition  of  Contest 
a. Defense Established 
If the evidence   establishes   a   full   or   partial   
defense,  the  CA  court  may  stay  enforcement  of  
the  registered  order,  continue  the  proceeding  to  
permit the production  of  additional  evidence,  
and   “issue   other   appropriate   orders.”   Any   
uncontested  portion  of  the  order,  however,  is  
confirmed and may be enforced by all remedies 
available under CA law. (
FC § 5700.607(b)). 
b. No Defense Established 
If   the   contesting   party   does   not   establish   a   
defense,   the   CA   court   “shall   issue   an   order   
confirming    the    (registered)    order.”    (
FC   §   
5700.607(c)).  If  the  obligor  is  unsuccessful  in  
contesting registration, the hearing is presumed 
to have been requested primarily for delay and if 
the   court   finds   the   hearing   was   requested   
primarily for delay, it shall order the payment of 
costs   and   reasonable   attorney   fees.   (
FC   §   
5700.313(c)). 
9. If No  Challenge,  Order  Confirmed 
If  there  is  no  challenge  to  the  registered  order,  the  
registered  order  is  confirmed  by  operation  of  law.  
(
FC § 5700.606(b)). 
a. Preclusive        Effect        of        Confirmation        
Confirmation  of    a  registered  order,  either  by 
operation  of    law  or  after  notice  and  hearing, 
precludes   further   contest   of    the order  “with 
respect   to   any   matter that   could   have   been 
asserted   at   the time   of     registration.” (
FC §

arrears filed with the registered orders is binding on 
parties pursuant to 
FC § 5700.607(a)(6). 
a. Arrears    Statement    Binding    on    Obligor    
“[A]bsent   timely   objection,   the statement   of 
arrears   included   in   a registration   statement 
becomes  binding  on  ‘the  nonregistering  party.’ 
(de  Leon  v.  Jenkins (2006)  143 Cal.App.4
th
  118 
[the LCSA registered a support order specifying 
that  Obligor  owed  no  arrears,  Obligee  failed  to  
contest within 20 days, Obligor sought 
confirmation  that  no  arrears  were  owed]).  The 
court held that only an overstatement of arrears 
is a cognizable defense under 
FC     §     
5700.607(a)(6),  and  thus  must  be  raised  by  the  
obligor,  if  at  all,  within  20  days  after  notice  of  
registration. 
b. Arrears  Statement  Not  Binding  on  Obligee  
The Jenkins   court   further  held that an 
understatement  of   arrears is not     fairly 
encompassed  by  any  of    the 
FC § 5700.607(a) 
objections, and     thus confirmation      cannot 
preclude  a  non-registering  obligee  from  later 
litigating additional arrears under the registered 
order. 
Further,  an  obligee  is  allowed  “to  contest  an  
obligor’s statement   of   child   support   arrears   
notwithstanding the obligee’s failure to request a 
hearing within 20 days of receiving notice of the 
order’s   registration.”   (State   ex   rel.   DES   v.   
Pandola   (2018)   408   P.3d   1254 [Obligor   filed   
registration  with  his  avowal  that  zero  arrears  
were  owing,  Obligee  failed  to  contest  within  20  
days]). The court noted that some of   the defenses 
to  registration  apply  only  to  obligors:  (1)  full  or  
partial  payment  has  been  made,  and  (2)  the  
statute  of  limitations  precludes  enforcement  of  
some  or     all   of     the  alleged   arrears, and   that 
“neither provision permits an obligee to claim an 
obligor understated the amount of arrears.”',

K.    MODIFICATION AFTER REGISTRATION  
1. Registration  Prerequisite 
A  party  or  support  enforcement  agency  seeking  to  
modify, or modify and enforce, a   child support order 
issued in another state must first register the order in 
CA if the order has not been registered. A petition for 
modification  may  be  filed  at  the  same  time  as  a  
request for registration, or later, and must specify the 
grounds  for  modification.  (FC  §  5700.609; 28  USC  §  
1738B(i)). 
2. Modification    Shifts    Exclusive    Jurisdictional    
Situs 
Provided  it  has  modification  jurisdiction  under  the  
above  standards,  upon  issuing  an  order  modifying  
the out-of  -state  child  support  order,  the  CA  court  
becomes   the   forum   with   CEJ   over   the   order.   
Thereafter,  no  other  court  may  exercise  jurisdiction  
to   modify   unless   the   jurisdictional   situs   again   
changes   under   the   FFCCSOA/UIFSA   jurisdiction   
rules. (FC § 5700.611(e); 28 USC §§ 1738B(d)-(f)). 
a. Issuing state’s “residual” jurisdiction 
After  the  jurisdictional  situs  shifts  to  CA,  the  
issuing state’s jurisdiction regarding the order is 
limited  in  the  same  manner  as  a  CA  court’s  
jurisdiction would be limited after an out-of  -state 
modification of   its order. (FC § 5700.612; 28 USC 
§ 1738B(g)). 
3. Governing  Law 
Having acquired CEJ over a   registered child support 
order  for  purposes  of  modification,  the  CA  court  
must  apply  CA  substantive  law  to  determine  the  
appropriate amount of support. (FC § 5700.611(b), FC 
§ 5700.303; 28 USC § 1738B(h)(1)). Moreover, parties 
cannot  stipulate  to  the application  of    a  different 
state’s  law.  In  IRMO  Crosby  and  Grooms  (2004)  
116 Cal.App.4

application  of  California  law  to  modify  an  Idaho',

order,  contending  that  pursuant  to  the  parties’  
marital settlement agreement, all matters affecting 
interpretation of that agreement shall be governed 
by   the   laws   of   Idaho.   The   Court   of   Appeal   
disagreed  holding  that  “parents  are  bound  by  
public  policy  extrinsic  to  their  own  agreements”  
and   because   application   of   Idaho   law   would   
“undermine   the   mandate   of   the   UIFSA,   it   is   
contrary to public policy and is not enforceable.” 
 NOTE: A CA court may not modify any aspect of 
the   out-of  -state   child   support   order   that   is   not   
modifiable  under  the  issuing  state’s  law,  including  
the duration of support. (
FC § 5700.611(c); 28 USC 
§ 1738B(h)(2)
). 
4. Filing  Copy  of  Modified  Order  with   Tribunals 
in Other States 
Within  30  days  after  issuance  of  a  modified  child  
support    order,    the    party    who    obtained    the    
modification  must  file  a  certified  copy  of  the  order  
with the issuing tribunal that had CEJ over the earlier 
order  and  with  each  tribunal  in  which  he  or  she  
knows   the   earlier   order   was   registered.   (
FC   §   
5700.614). 
5. Compare—CA Recognition of Modifications by a 
Tribunal in Another State 
CA  courts  must  recognize  a  modification  of  a  CA  
child  support  order  by  another  state  that  assumed  
jurisdiction in accordance with the FFCCSOA/UIFSA 
(
FC § 5700.612), and, upon request: 
a. May enforce the order that was modified only 
as to amounts accruing before the modification; 
b. May provide     “appropriate     relief”     for     
violations of   its order which occurred before the 
effective date of the modification; and 
c. Shall  recognize  the  other  state’s  modifying  
order,  upon  registration,  for  enforcement.  (

3) Request for Specific Measures 
 Specific Measures  are  certain  duties  of  
administrative  cooperation  and  can  be  
requested;  by  one  Central  Authority  to  
another Central Authority; 
 These requests are separate from 
applications; 
 Examples: 
i. Locate services 
ii. Financial information provision 
iii. Paternity establishment 
iv. Service of   documents 
v. Obtaining evidence 
g. Registration of International Hague 
Convention Support Orders 
1) Time to Contest (
FC §   5700.707(b)) 
The contesting party must request a   hearing 
within  30  days  of  the  date  that  notice  was  
mailed if he/she resides in the U.S., or within 
60 days if he/she resides outside the U.S. 
 NOTE: CA  courts  serve  notice  on  the  
nonregistering   party   typically   by   mail.   
Therefore,  the  time  for  service  is  extended.

Procedure in IV-D Cases, Part G. Service of 
Pleadings. 
2) Defenses     to     Registration     (FC     §     
5700.708) 
 Recognition   and   enforcement   of   the   
order   is   manifestly   incompatible   with   
public policy, including failing to observe

 Order  is  not  enforceable  in  the issuing 
country; 
 Order obtained by procedural fraud; 
 Record lacks authenticity or   integrity;

recognition and enforcement in this state; 
 Payment of alleged arrears, in whole or 
part; 
 It is a default order without either prior 
notice  and  opportunity  to  be  heard,  or  
post-order   notice   and   opportunity   to   
appeal; or 
 The   order   violates FC   §   5700.711   
(modification  where  obligee  remains  a  
resident of   the foreign country where the 
support order was issued). 
3) Effect of Non-Recognition 
If an order is not recognized because of   a lack 
of   personal   jurisdiction,   fraud,   or     default 
without  due  process,  the  tribunal  may  not  
dismiss   the   proceeding  without  allowing  a 
reasonable  time  for  a  party  to  request  the  
establishment  of  a  new  Convention  support 
order. 
2. Reciprocity 
There   are   certain   countries   that   are   considered   
federal     “foreign     reciprocating     countries”.     In     
addition, CA has established reciprocity with several 
countries.  If  reciprocity  is  established,  the  foreign  
country is treated the same as another state in the U.S. 
(See Willmer v. Willmer (2006) 144 Cal.App.4
th
 951). 
Note  that  all  of  the  CA  agreements  are  based  on

3. No UIFSA 
Other  countries  do  not  have  UIFSA  and  are  not  
required to use federal or state forms. 
4. Notarization  Alternatives 
Many foreign   countries   don’t   have   notaries,   so   
documents   from   other   countries   may   be   signed   
under  penalty  of  perjury  or  sworn  to  and  signed  
before an official authorized to administer an oath, a 
consular agent, or a judge. The change under UIFSA 
2008   from   signing   documents   “under   oath”   to   
“under penalty of   perjury” addresses this difference. 
5. New Definitions 
Under  UIFSA  2008, the  term “state” only  includes 
U.S. states, territories and Indian nations or   tribes. (It 
does not include foreign countries, whereas previous 
versions  of  UIFSA  included  foreign  countries  in  the  
definition   of   “State.”).   Under   UIFSA   2008,   the   
definitions relating to foreign countries are: 
a. “Foreign country” means a country, including 
a  political  subdivision  thereof,  other  than  the  
United  States,  that  authorizes  the  issuance  of  
support orders and: 
1) Which  has  been  declared  under  the  law  of  
the United States to be a foreign reciprocating 
country; 
2) Which     has     established     a     reciprocal     
arrangement for child support with this state as 
provided in

3) Which   has   enacted   a   law   or   established   
procedures for the issuance and enforcement of 
support orders which are substantially similar 
to the procedures under this part; or 
4) In  which  the  Convention  is  in  force  with  
respect     to     the     United     States.     (
FC    §    
5700.102(5)
). 
b. “Foreign   support   order”   means   a   support   
order of a foreign tribunal. (
FC § 5700.102(6)). 
c. “Foreign       tribunal”       means       a       court,       
administrative agency, or   quasi-judicial entity of 
a    foreign    country    which    is    authorized   to   
establish, enforce, or   modify support orders or to 
determine   parentage   of   a   child.   The   term   
includes    a    competent    authority    under    the    
Convention. (
FC § 5700.102(7)). 
d. “Issuing  foreign  country”  means  the  foreign  
country  in  which  a  tribunal  issues  a  support  
order or a judgment determining parentage of a 
child. (
FC § 5700.102(12)). 
6. Comity 
If a foreign country does not fall into one of the four 
definitions of foreign country, registration cannot be 
used  to  modify  or  enforce  the  order.  However,  a  
complaint could be filed requesting recognition of the 
foreign order based on principles of comity. Comity 
is the acceptance or adoption of a    decision by a   court 
of another jurisdiction based on public policy rather 
than legal mandate. 
 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   The   LCSA   does   not   have   
authority  to  refuse to  register  an order  that  is  valid  on 
its  face;  only  a  court  may  refuse  enforcement.  If  the 
court  refuses  to  enforce,  request  establishment  of  a 
new order immediately.',

1. Tribal  Sovereignty 
Indian   tribes   within   the   US   possess   sovereign   
authority  over  their  people  and  territory.   Tribal 
sovereignty is the right for tribes to make their own 
laws  and  be  governed  by  them.   Tribes  retain  this  
authority   unless   Congress   specifically   provides   
otherwise. (Michigan     v.     Bay     Mills     Indian     
Community (2014)  134  S.  Ct.  2024.)  Federal  and 
state   governments   are   required   to   engage   in   
government-to-government   relationships   with   all   
federally recognized tribes. 
2. Public  Law 280 
Public   Law   280   is   a   federal   statute   enacted   by   
Congress  in  1953  which  limits  tribal  sovereignty  by  
granting     state     courts,     including     California,     
concurrent   jurisdiction   over   criminal   and   some 
civil  matters  involving  Indians  as  litigants  within  
tribal  boundaries.  (See  
17 USC  §1738.)  The  law 
does  not  grant  states  regulatory  power  over  tribes 
or  lands  held  in  trust  by  the  US,  however.  The  test 
of  whether  a  state  law  may  be  applied  on  Indian  
land  is  whether  the  application  of  that  law  would  
interfere   with   the   tribe’s   right   to   self-govern. 
(Organized  Village  of  Kake  v.  Egan  (1962)  369  US  
60). 
 
B. JURISDICTION  
1. LCSA  Obligation 
State  IV-D  agencies  have  an  obligation  to  equally  
provide   services   to   all   children   and   families,   
including those on tribal land. (Howe v. Ellenbecker 
(1991) 774 F. Supp. 1224). 
2. State  Court  Jurisdiction 
States are prohibited from unreasonably interfering 
with    the    rights    of    Indian    self-    government.

(1962)  369  US  60.)   However,  a  state  court  has  
jurisdiction   over   an   individual   member   of   a   
federally  recognized  tribe  living  on  a  reservation  
to reimburse the county for public assistance paid 
to support the member’s child. (County of Inyo v. 
Jeff (1991) 227 Ca. App.3d 487.) 
3. Tribal Court  Jurisdiction 
Tribal   courts   have   concurrent   jurisdiction   over   
domestic   relation   actions   if   they   are   willing   to   
assume  jurisdiction.  (Sanders  v.  Robinson (9
th 
Cir. 
1988)  864 F.2d.  630.;    Baker  v.  John (1999)  982  P.2d 
739.) 
a. Jurisdiction Over Tribal Members 
In general,  tribal  sovereignty  applies  in  
matters  that  affect  members  who  live  on  
tribal  land.  When  one  or  both  parties  are  
members  of  a  specific  tribe  and  live  on  
tribal land, the tribe will have jurisdiction. 
(Montana v. United States (1981) 450 U.S. 
544). 
b. Jurisdiction Over Non-Members 
Tribal jurisdiction over the conduct of   non-
members exists      only      in      limited      
circumstances  (for  example,  non-members 
who  enter  consensual  relationships  with  
the  tribe  or  its  members,  or  activity  that  
directly affects the tribe’s political integrity, 
economic   security,   health   or   welfare).   
(Strate  v.  A-1  Contractors  (1997)  520  U.S.  
438). 
 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Contact  the  tribe  in  question 
prior  to  sending  a  case  to  them  to  determine  if  it  meets  
that  tribe’s  jurisdictional  requirements  (i.e.  one  or  more  
parties  are  members  of  the  tribe,  one  or  both  parties  
reside  on  the  reservation  or  tribal  land,  noncustodial  
parent  is  employed  by  tribal  entity,  etc.)  Requirements  
will not be the same for all tribes.',

C. TRIBAL COURTS  
1. Tribal Courts  Generally 
There  are  currently  22  tribal  courts  in  California.  
Most  tribal  child  support  hearings  are  judicial,  but  
some  may  be  administrative,  or  a  combination  of  
both.  The  California  Tribal  Courts  Directory  can  be  
found at 
https://www.courts.ca.gov/14400.htm#panel14773. 
2. Applicable  Laws 
a. Full   Faith   and   Credit   for   Child   Support   
Orders Act 
28 USC §1738B is the Full Faith and Credit for 
Child  Support  Orders  Act  (FFCCSOA,)  which  
requires   the   appropriate   authorities   of   each   
“State”  (including  Indian  Country)  to  enforce  
child support orders if they are made consistent 
with  the  provisions  of the  statute.   FFCCSOA 
further provides that child support orders cannot 
be modified except following the statute. 
1) Requirements 
To  be  consistent  with  FFCCSOA,  the  issuing  
court must have had subject matter jurisdiction 
and  personal  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  and  
the  parties  must  have  been  given  reasonable  
notice and opportunity to be heard. (
17 USC § 
1738B(c)
). 
2) Continuing Jurisdiction 
A state or tribal court has continuing, exclusive 
jurisdiction over its order if the state or tribe is 
the  child’s  residence  or  the  residence  of  any  
individual  party  unless  the  court  of  another  
state  or  tribe,  acting  following  the  statute  has  
modified   the   order.   This   is   analogous   to   
UIFSA’s CEJ. (
17 USC § 1738B(d).) 
3) Determining Controlling Order 
If  multiple tribal and state orders exist, 45 CFR 
§1738B(f) provides   the   rules   to   determine   
which order should be recognized for purposes',

of    continuing,    exclusive    jurisdiction    and    
enforcement. 
 State Law 
The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act 
(UIFSA)  requires  California  state  courts  to  
apply  its  provisions  to  tribal orders.    (
FC 
§5700.102 (26).) However, tribal courts are 
not required to adopt or to apply to UIFSA. 
 Tribal Law 
Each  tribe  is  unique  in  terms  of  the  laws  
applied  to  child  support.  Most tribes  have  
their own constitution and tribal codes. 
 Comity 
In   situations   where   there   is   no   specific   
statutory  mandate  for  full  faith  and  credit,  
the general rule is that tribal court orders are 
entitled to comity. 
3. Appearances 
Appearances  in  the  tribal  court  by  LCSA  attorneys  
will be governed by each tribal court’s unique rules 
and  procedures.  In  situations  where  appearances 
are   necessary,   the   LSCA   should   research   the   
requirements  of each  tribe  in  their  area  and  take 
the  necessary  steps  to  obtain  approval  to  appear  in  
tribal court. 
 
D. TRIBAL IV-D  
1. Tribal IV-D Generally 
Federal  funding  for  direct  grants  is  available  to  
federally  recognized  tribes  to  establish  and  operate  
child  support  enforcement  programs.  (
42  USC  §  
655(f)
).  The  regulations  for  the establishment  and 
operation of tribal child support programs are found 
at 
45 CFR § 309 et seq. 
As  of  February  1,  2019,  there  are  574  Tribal  entities  
recognized  by  and  eligible  for  funding  and  services  
from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”) by virtue 
of their status as Indian Tribes.  There are currently',
