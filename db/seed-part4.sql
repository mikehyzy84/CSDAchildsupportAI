  'XIV – TRIBAL CASES 
265 
 
 
109   federally   recognized   tribes   in   the   State   of   
California,  with  60  tribal  agencies  operating  child  
support programs, which provide services to Native 
American  families  consistent  with  tribal  values  and  
cultures. 
2. Yurok Tribe 
The Yurok Tribe in Eureka, CA is the only California 
Tribe with a comprehensive child support program. 
3. Requirements 
Tribal   IV-D   programs   must   provide   paternity   
establishment,      support      order      establishment,      
modification  and  enforcement  of  orders,  including  
the  requirement  that  tribal  employers  comply  with  
IWOs,   and   locate   services.   There   is   no   current   
requirement   that   tribal   support   orders   include   
medical  support.  However,  there  is  no  prohibition  
for a tribal support order to do so. Presently, no tribal 
agencies in California recoup TANF benefits.  Tribal 
TANF recipients who open a   child support case with 
state IV-D agencies are treated as non-assigned cases. 
4. Paternity  Establishment 
Tribes establish paternity following tribal law, code, 
or   custom.   States   are   required   to   honor   tribal   
paternity  orders  when  they  are  the  basis  for  child  
support orders under tribal law. Likewise, tribes are 
required to honor the states’ paternity order when it 
is  the  basis  for  child  support  orders  through  state  
court. (CSSIN Letter: 10-06). 
5. Enforcement of  Tribal Orders 
Tribal  child  support  orders  are  entitled  to  the  full  
faith  and  credit  accorded  to  state  orders  when  the  
tribe  has  properly  exercised  jurisdiction  over  the  
parties   and   the   subject   matter.   Orders   can   be   
registered and enforced but not modified if the tribe 
has  continuing,  exclusive  jurisdiction.  (
28  USC  §  
1738B; CSSIN Letter: 10-06).

Federal  regulations  require  tribes  to  include  in  
their   tribal   CSE   plans   tribal   law,   code   or   
regulations     that     describe     the     types     of     
collection/enforcement  actions  the  tribe  can  use.  
The      only      collection/enforcement      method      
mandated  by  federal  regulation  for  tribes  and  
tribal organizations is income withholding. 
6. Enforcement      of      In-Kind      Orders      (Non- 
Monetary) 
Tribal  orders  may  contain  an  “in-kind”  order  (non- 
monetary), in which orders for child support are paid 
via   goods   or   services,   i.e.   to   supply   a   cord   of   
firewood   every   month   to   the   custodial   party’s   
residence. The LCSA must request through the tribal 
court that the in-kind order be assigned a monetary 
value  pursuant  to  
45  CFR  §  309.105(a)(3).  Non- 
cash  support  cannot  be  used  to  satisfy  assigned  
support,  including  assigned  arrears.  (CSSIN  Letter:  
10-06) 
7. Information  Sharing 
Information  may  only  be  shared  if  the  state  has  a  
cooperative  agreement  with  the  tribe  to  perform  
certain  IV-D functions,  such  as  to  establish/modify  
court orders, establish paternity, etc. The data to be 
provided   must   be   necessary   to   perform   these   
functions  and  the  tribe,  through  the  cooperative  
agreement, is bound to the same confidentiality rules 
that  apply  to  State  IV-D  programs.  LCSAs  may  
release  information  to  the  extent  allowed  in  
FC  §  
17212(b)(1).)   Requests   from   federally   recognized 
Tribal IV-D programs should be honored in the same 
way    as    requests    from    a    recognized    federal    
reciprocating country. 
8. Differences  Between  Tribal  IV-D  and  State  IV-
D Programs 
Policies and procedures for Tribal IV-D programs are 
still  evolving,  but  some  differences  from  state  IV-D 
programs are:',

9. Transfer   of   IV-D   Cases   Between   State   and   
Tribal Court 
The California Rules of   Court, Rule 5.372 defines the 
procedure   for   the   transfer   of   Title   IV-D   child   
support  cases  between  the  state  court  and  a  tribal  
court. 
a. Notice of Intent to  Transfer 
Before  filing  a  motion  for  case  transfer,  the  
requesting party must provide all parties with 
notice    of    their    right    to    object    and    the    
procedures for objecting. 
b. Determination   of   Concurrent   Jurisdiction   
When ruling on a motion to transfer, the state 
court must first make a threshold 
determination  that   concurrent   jurisdiction 
exists.  There  is  a  presumption  of  concurrent  
jurisdiction if the dependent(s) of   the action are 
enrolled  tribal  members  or  are  eligible  for  
enrollment. 
c. Objecting to Transfer 
If concurrent jurisdiction is found, the transfer 
will  occur  unless  a  party  has  objected  in  a  
timely   manner.   On   the   filing   of   a   timely 
objection, the court must conduct a hearing on 
the record considering all the relevant facts set 
forth in 5.372(f.) The superior court judge may',

attempt  to  resolve  any  procedural  issues  by  
communicating  with  the  tribal  court  judge,  
provided the parties are given the opportunity 
to  participate  in  all  communications  and  a  
record of the communication is prepared 
d. Disposition 
If  a  transfer  request  is  denied,  the  court  must  
state on the record, the basis for the denial.  If 
the court grans the request, it must issue a   final 
order. 
e. Proceedings After Transfer 
Once   the   superior   court   has   granted   the   
application to transfer and the tribal court has 
accepted  jurisdiction,  the  entire  file  must  be  
transferred   and   no   further   filings   may   be   
accepted by the superior court, except upon the 
finding  by  the  tribal  court  that  it  is  not  in  the  
child’s  best  interest  to  retain  jurisdiction.   In 
this case, the superior court must not reject the 
case. 
 
E. ESTABLISHMENT AND MODIFICATION  
1. Service  of  Process 
In California, tribal members may be served on or   off 
tribal land.  (Nevada v. Hicks (2001) 533 U.S. 353). 
 
 PRACTICE     POINT:     Cooperation     with     Tribal     
Government  and/or  Tribal  Police  for  service  of  process 
is  highly  recommended.  If  service  is  required  on  tribal  
land,   contact   the   individual   Tribe   to   ascertain   their 
policy.  If  service  is  required  outside  of  California  and  if  
Long  Arm  Jurisdiction  exists,  service  may  be  made  by  
mail   (CCP   §   415.30 and CCP   §   415.40)   or   by 
personal   service.   If   no   Long   Arm,   the   LCSA   must 
establish an interstate action with   the appropriate 
State or Tribal IV-D agency. 
2. Trust Money as  Income 
Indian  trust  money  (money  derived  from  leases  of  
Indian Trust Allotment lands, which is exempt from 
liability   for   any   obligations   owed   by   Indians',

pursuant  to  25  USC  §  410),  can  be  considered  
income   for   determining   guideline   support,   but   
cannot be used for enforcement of   the support order. 
(
IRMO Purnell (1997) 52 Cal.App.4
th
 527).  
 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   Indian   Tribes   that   conduct   
gaming  activities  on  a  California  reservation  may  use  
gaming  profits  for  all  tribe  members’  general  welfare. 
The  law  allows  tribes  to  distribute  gaming  income  to 
each   tribal   member   (per   capita)   after   meeting   or   
accounting for   tribal obligations.   The tribal member 
may  be  required  to  pay  state  and  federal  income  taxes  
on the per capita. (IRC § 3402(r)). 
3. Modification 
A  tribal  order  is  entitled  to  full  faith  and  credit.  (
28 
USC § 1738B). A state court cannot modify a tribal 
court  order  unless  the  tribe  no  longer  retains  CEJ.  
(
FC § 5700.205; 28 USC § 1738B(d)-(e)). 
F. ENFORCEMENT  
1. Exempt  Indian Money 
While 
25  USC  §  410  exempts  any  money  accruing  
from  the  lease  of  lands  held  for  an  Indian  from  
liability for any debt owed by that Indian, the money 
loses  its  identity  as  Indian  property  once  deposited  
in a   bank account outside tribal land. (IRMO Purnell 
(1997) 52 Cal.App.4
th
 527). 
2. Income  Withholding  Orders 
An  IWO  issued  to  the tribe  or  tribal  employer  is  
voluntary   unless   it   is   included   in   a   Tribal-State 
Gaming  Compact  or  it  is  received  by  a  Tribal  IV-D 
agency  in  accordance  with  their  tribal  due  process  
requirements.    (
45    CFR    §309.110). However, 
California  employers  are  required  to  honor  tribal  
court or Tribal IV-D IWOs. (
FC §5230.1). 
 
 PRACTICE     POINT:     Many     Tribes     voluntarily     
cooperate  with  LCSAs,  so  contacting  a  Tribe  regarding 
a  case  is  helpful.  Additionally,  once  tribal  funds  are  
distributed   to   the   obligor,   all      enforcement   remedies 
may be used.

If a   tribe or   tribal employer does not honor an IWO: 
a. If  the  tribe  has  a  tribal  court,  use  the  tribal  
court registration for enforcement process. 
b. If  the  tribe  has  a  Tribal  IV-D  agency,  use  an  
intergovernmental referral to enforce the order 
c. If  there  is  no  tribal  court  or  Tribal  IV-D 
agency,  the  LCSA  may  attempt  to  develop  an  
intergovernmental agreement with the tribe. 
4. Individual  Indian Monies  (IIM) 
Individual   Indian   Money   (IIM)   accounts   can   be   
encumbered with an order from a court of   competent 
jurisdiction.  (
25  CFR  §  115.601(b)(1)).   IIM   and   
“court  of  competent  jurisdiction”  are  defined  in  
25 
CFR § 115.002. 
5. Per Capita 
Some  tribal  ordinances  allow  enforcement  against  
per capita (individual distribution of tribal revenue) 
monies through the tribal court. 
G. HEALTH INSURANCE     
A child’s eligibility for Indian Health Service satisfies the 
requirement for health insurance, even when the child is 
receiving Medicaid. (OCSS Policy Interpretation 94-07).

1. Access 
SOP may be attempted by any method provided by 
law,   but   if   the   servicemember   must   be   served   
formally   on   military   property,   federal   law,    and 
military   regulations   will   determine   whether   the   
process server may gain access to the installation. 
a. Military Installation Jurisdiction 
Sometimes  federal  jurisdiction  is  so  exclusive  
that  a  state  process  cannot  be  served  on  the  
installation.   In   most   cases,   however,   states   
reserve  the  right  to  serve  civil  and  criminal  
process.  This  is  true  on  military  installations  
where   there   is   concurrent   or   partial   federal   
legislative   jurisdiction   or   where   the   federal   
government just has a proprietary interest in the 
land or buildings. (
32 CFR § 516.10). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  The  best  way  to  determine  an  
installation’s type of jurisdiction is to call the 
installation  legal  office.  The  installation  legal  office  can  
also    inform you of    the    policies    and regulations 
governing  service  of  process  on  the  installation.  The  
installation provost marshal or law enforcement 
section is the usual conduit. 
2. Voluntary  Acceptance  of  Service 
All  branches  of  the  armed  services  have  regulations  
requiring military members to take care of their civil 
paternity and support issues. A military commander 
may not involuntarily serve the member with process 
but   may   allow   the   member   to   accept   service   
voluntarily.  The  member  will  usually  be  given  the  
chance to speak to a legal assistance attorney before 
deciding whether to accept the documents.

 PRACTICE  POINT:  It  may  be  helpful  to  send  the  
pleadings   and a   Notice   and Acknowledgment    of 
Receipt   to   the unit   commander   and explain   the 
adverse  effects  that  can  result  from  delays  (e.g.  the  
accrual  of  significant  child  support  arrears  and  lack  of  
support  for  the  minor  children).  This  is  an  effective  
method  to  avoid  potential  delays  in  getting  the  member  
timely served. 
 
B. MILITARY INCOME  
1. Leave and  Earnings  Statement  (LES) 
A  servicemember’s  pay  is  recorded  on  a  LES  that  
normally  shows  a  variety  of  income  figures  and  
deductions. The basic income considered is the Base 
Pay,   Basic   Allowance   for Housing,   and   Basic 
Allowance    for Subsistence. Individual service 
members may also be eligible for other types of pay, 
such as flight pay and hazardous duty pay. 
a. Basic Allowance Housing (BAH) 
BAH  is  a  non-taxable  supplement  to  provide  
uniformed     servicemembers     with     housing     
compensation   based   on   comparable   civilian 
costs of   housing in that geographical area. 
 PRACTICE      POINT:      In      some      cases,      a      
servicemember  who lives  in  base housing will have 
little  or  no  BAH  reflected  on  the  LES  or  will  show  BAH  
paid  in  and  then  deducted  in  full  to  cover  the  costs  of  
base housing.  Part  or  all     the amount  of  BAH  may  still 
be  included  as  income  when  base  housing  is  provided 
for  a  servicemember.  The  receipt  of  BAH  reduces  the  
servicemember’s   cost   of   living   and   is   considered   
compensation  whether  actually  received  or  used  for  on  
base housing. 
b. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) 
BAS  is  a  non-taxable  supplement  intended  to  
offset  the  servicemembers’  costs  for  meals.  The  
amount  of  BAS  is  adjusted  each  year  based  on 
the increase in  food  prices  as  measured  by  the  
USDA food cost index.

purposes of child support. (IRMO Stanton (2010) 190 
Cal.App.4
th
  547).  The  reason  is  that servicemembers 
receive   extra  money   for   housing  and   food, and 
guideline  calculations  are  based  on  income  before  
housing and food expenses.
 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Failure  to  include  BAH  and  BAS 
in the guideline  reduces  income  available  for  support  
despite  BAH  and  BAS  reducing the servicemember’s 
own cost  of  living.   Some  judicial  officers  may  wish  to 
exclude    BAH/BAS    if    it    is    not    received    by    the    
servicemember.    However,   BAH/BAS are employer-
paid compensation and  should  be  included  as  non-
taxable  income  whether   received or   used   to   offset 
base housing costs.  
Note:  Pending  legislation  will  make  BAH/BAS  income  
under Family Code 4058(a) 
3. Taxation 
Base   pay   is   taxable,   while   BAH   and   BAS   are   
nontaxable.  Consider  that  wages  labeled  “pay”  are  
generally   taxable   income   while   wages   labeled   
“allowance”   are   generally   nontaxable. However, 
military pay earned in a combat zone is non-taxable. 
Upon separation from the military, retirement pay is 
taxable, but military  disability  pay  is  not.  Refer  to  
https://militarypay.defense.gov/Pay/Tax-
Information/ 
4. Entitlements 
Army  and  Navy  LESs  list  child  support  deductions  
both   in   the   Entitlements   box   (upper   left)   and   
Deductions box (center). It gives the impression that 
the   government   has   paid   the   soldier   the   child   
support deduction amount. They are not paying that 
amount. It is a straight deduction – disregard the item 
in the Entitlement box. 
5. Reserves  and  National Guard 
Active  Reserve  and  National  Guard  members  are  
typically    paid    two    (“drill”)    days    per    month.    
Additionally,    members    are    paid    14    days    for

7. State of  Domicile 
Be sure to ask military members where they file taxes 
–    it  is  usually  their  state  of    domicile  (rather than 
residence).  The  military  member’s  domicile  may  be  
different than what is  stated on the LES for purposes 
of income tax deductions.

1. Military  Service  Protections 
Active-duty members of   the military and active-duty 
National  Guard  are  entitled  to  certain  protections  
under  the  Servicemembers  Civil  Relief  Act  (SCRA).  
(

If  it  appears  that  the  defendant  is  in  military  
service,  the  court  cannot  enter  a  judgment  until  
after  appointing  an  attorney  to  represent  the  
defendant. (
50 USC §   3931(b)(2); Allen v. Allen 
(1947) 182 P.2d 551; Price v. McBeath (2008) 989 
So.2d  444 (concurrence)).  After  an  attorney  is  
appointed,   the   attorney   should   be   given   a   
reasonable   amount   of   time   to   contact   the   
servicemember.  Then,  if  no  request  for  a  stay  is  
filed,   the   LCSA   should   proceed   with   the   
establishment of an order. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  The attorney  is  appointed for 
the  limited  purpose  of  protecting  the  servicemember’s  
rights  under  the  SCRA  and  not  for  the  merits  of  the 
case.   If the servicemember   wishes   to   retain   the 
attorney  for  the  merits  of  the  case,  he  or  she  is  free  to 
do  so.  If  not,  any  on-the-record  discussion  or  pleadings  
addressing  the  merits  of  the  case  may  constitute  a  
general appearance. 
b. Post-Judgment Motions 
This    procedure    applies    to    post-judgment 
motions   and   the   original   judgment.   (IRMO 
Lopez (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 776). 
c. Vacate or Set Aside 
If  a  default  is  taken  against  a  servicemember  
during  his  or  her  period  of  military  service,  or  
within  60  days  after  termination  of  service,  the  
servicemember can move to set aside the default. 
The  application  must  be  filed  no  later  than  90  
days  after  the  date  of  termination  of  or  release  
from  military  service.  Upon  a  showing  that  the  
servicemember’s   military   service   “materially   
affected” (See 5d of   this section) his or   her ability 
to  defend  against  the  action  and  that  he  or  she  
has a meritorious defense, the court shall reopen 
the  judgment  to  allow  the  servicemember  to  
defend the action. (
50 USC §   3931(g)(2)(A)(B)).',

5. Staying  the  Action  or  Proceeding 
The SCRA also allows the servicemember to obtain a 
temporary stay of   the proceedings if  the individual’s 
circumstances warrant. 
a. Initial Mandatory Stay 
Pursuant  to  
50  USC  §  3931(d),  the  court  must  
grant a stay for at least 90 days upon application 
of  counsel,  or  on  the  court’s  own  motion,  if  the  
court determines that: 
1) The  servicemember  may  have  a  defense,  
which  cannot  be  presented  in  his  or  her  
absence; or 
2) The appointed attorney has not been able 
to locate the servicemember after exercising 
due diligence. 
b. Case Law: Mandatory Stay 
A  juvenile  court  erred  in  refusing  to  stay  the  
dispositional   hearing   for   90   days   when   the   
father’s  commanding  officer  provided  a  letter  
stating  the  father  was  on  active  duty  on  a  ship  
deployed  to  the  Middle  East  and  he  could  not  
take  leave  for  the  remainder  of  his  deployment.  
(In  re  A.R. (2009)  170  Cal.App.4

  733,  741;  see 
also In  re  Amber  M. (2010)  184  Cal.App.4
th
  1223 
[even if  the stay request did not technically meet 
all the SCRA requirements, the stay should have 
been granted because it was undisputed that the 
father was unavailable to appear at the hearing]). 
c. Additional Discretionary Stay 
Pursuant  to  
50 USC § 3932(b),  when  an  active  
duty servicemember  has  notice  of  the  action  or  
proceeding,  the  court  may,  on  its  own  motion,  
and      shall,      upon      application      of      the      
servicemember,  stay  the  action  for  at  least  90  
days, if:',

1) A    letter    or    other    communication    is

future date he or she will be able to appear; 
and 
2) A    letter    or    other    communication    is    
provided      from      the      servicemember’s      
commanding     officer     stating     that     the     
servicemember’s     current     military     duty     
prevents him or   her from appearing and that 
leave is not authorized to allow him or   her to 
appear. 
d. Case Law: Material Affect 
“Material  affect”  depends  on  the  circumstances  
of the particular case. One court upheld a denial 
of    a    request    for    additional    stay    by    a    
servicemember   stationed   in   Iraq   in   juvenile   
dependency   proceedings   because   the   court   
found    member’s    military    service    did    not    
adversely  affect  his  ability  to  reunify  with  his  
child.  (George  P.  v.  Superior  Court  (2005)  127  
Cal.App.4
th
 216).  
e. A  Stay  Request  is  Not  an  Appearance  or  
Waiver 
A  request  for  a stay   does   not   constitute   an   
appearance   for   jurisdictional   purposes   or   a   
waiver of any substantive or   procedural defense. 
(
50 USC § 3932(c)). 
f. More      Additional      Discretionary      Stays      
Additional  stays  may  be  requested  in  the  same  
manner as above based on a   continuing “material 
effect”  of  the  servicemember’s  military  duty  on  
his or   her ability to appear in the action. (
50 USC 
§  3932(d)).  If  the  court  refuses  to  grant  an  
additional stay, the court shall appoint counsel to 
represent the servicemember.',

g. Stay as Shield 
The  protections  of  the  SCRA  are  intended  as  “a  
shield,  not  a  sword.  The  goal  of  preventing  a  
servicemember from being disadvantaged by his 
or  her  military  service  to  the  country  is  not  
furthered     by     giving     servicemembers     an     
unwarranted  advantage  over  civilian  litigants.”

h. Leave 
Servicemembers  are  entitled  to  2.5  days  of paid 
leave  per  month.  Their  current  accrued  leave  
balance is prominently displayed on their Leave 
and Earnings Statement. 
6. Military  Requirements  for  Support 
When  dealing  with  servicemembers,  remember  that  
they  have  an  additional  incentive  to  comply  with  
court  orders.  The  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  
(UCMJ)  (and  internal  regulations  of  most  military  
branches)  requires  servicemembers  to  support  their  
dependents.  (
10  USC  §  801  et  seq.  and 10  USC  §  
933). 
7.  Reduced   Interest   Rate   for Pre-Active   Duty 
Debt 
Debts    owed    by    a    servicemember    before    the    
servicemember enters the military or, for reservists or 
National  Guard,  before  activation  shall  not  bear  an  
interest rate of   more than 6   percent during the period 
of military service, and interest at a rate more than 6 
percent per year that would otherwise be incurred is 
forgiven. (
50 USC § 3937(a)). 
a. Written Notice 
To  obtain  this  relief,  the  servicemember  must  
provide written notice to the creditor along with 
a  copy  of  the  military  orders  calling  them  to  
active duty. (
50 USC § 3937(b)).',

a   substantial   portion   of   military   pay   consists   of   
nontaxable allowances  such  as  BAH  and  BAS.  These  
nontaxable  allowances  may  increase  the  amount  of 
“take  home”  pay  of  the  military  member.  In  addition,  
some civilian    employers    will continue to    pay    a 
reservist’s  regular  civilian  salary  during  their  period  of  
activation.',

OVERVIEW 
Tax returns are a valuable source of information that may 
aid  in  the  determination  of  income  available  for  support.  
Tax returns provide an overview of earnings and may be 
helpful in cases where a person’s income fluctuates due to 
seasonal employment or is derived from multiple sources.  
Additionally,  when  a  person  receives  income  from  self-
employment or from a business entity, an LCSA attorney 
may   need   to   analyze   a   business   tax   return,   which   
includes  more  complex  tax  schedules  that  explain  the  
gross income and business expenses that affect a person’s 
tax  obligations  and,  in  turn,  affect  their  income  available  
for support.
 
 
The  LCSA  may  seek  to  review  tax  returns  at  both  the  
administrative Review and Adjustment phase and as part 
of the discovery process when a hearing is pending. 
1.  Prior to Commencing a Proceeding 
The   Family   Code   provides   for   an   inexpensive   
process    for    the    discovery    of    facts    before    the    
commencement  of  a  proceeding.  (
FC  §  3660).  As  
part  of  the  LCSA’s  Review  and  Adjustment  process,  
the  LCSA  may  serve  a  request,  without  leave  of  
court,  for  the production  of  a  completed  current  
income and expense declaration. (
FC § 3664(a)).  
2. The  Family  Code  Requires  Attachment  of  Tax  
Returns to the Income and Expense Declaration 
Both parties are required to complete, file, and serve 
current  Income  and  Expense  Declarations  (I&Es)  
(JCF   FL-150)   for   all   child,   spousal,   and   family   
support hearings. A Financial Statement (Simplified) 
(JCF FL-155) is also acceptable for hearings regarding 
child  support-only  matters.  (
CRC  § 5.260).  While 
the  forms  themselves  instruct  the  parties  to  take  a  
copy  of  their  latest  federal  tax  return  to  the  court  
hearing,  the  Family  Code  mandates  the  attachment  
of the prior year’s state and federal personal income

tax returns. (FC § 3665). 
3. After   A   Motion   is   Filed:   Production    and 
Discovery  of  Tax  Returns 
In a   child, family, or   spousal support proceeding, tax 
returns   are   required   to   be   produced   and   are   
discoverable. (
FC § 3552(a)-(b)). The production of 
tax  returns  is  also  required  on  an  application  for  
expedited support orders. (
FC § 3629(a)). 
a. Request for Tax Returns 
Tax   returns   are   rarely   attached   to   the   I&E, 
therefore,  it  may  be  necessary  to  request  them 
from the parties prior to the hearing or to ask the 
court  to  order  them  be  produced  while  at  the  
initial  hearing.  Formal  discovery  methods  can  
also   be   used   to   obtain   the   documents   (e.g.,   
Family  Law  Form    Interrogatories    (JCF    FL-
145); Interrogatories (
CCP § 2030.010); Demand 
for Production of Documents (
CCP § 2031.010); 
or Notice in Lieu of Subpoena. (
CCP § 1987)).    
4. Confidentiality  of  Tax  Returns 
Federal  Tax  Information  (FTI)  is  confidential  and  
may   only   be   used   by   authorized   persons   for   
authorized      purposes.      (
26 USC     §     6103). 
Unauthorized  inspection  and  disclosure  of  FTI  can  
result  in  criminal  and  civil  fines  and  imprisonment.  
(
26 USC §   7213; 26 USC §   7213A; 26 USC §   7431). 
Under   California   law,   tax   returns   may   not   be   
disclosed  to  anyone  except  the  court,  the  party’s  
attorney,    the    party’s    accountant,    or    financial    
consultant(s)  assisting  with  matters  related  to  the  
proceeding,  or  any  other  person  permitted  by  the  
court. (
FC § 3665(b)). 
5. Refusal  to   Comply 
No  party  to  a  child,  family,  or  spousal  support  
proceeding may refuse to submit copies of   their state 
or   federal   income   tax   return   to   the   court   for   
examination,  whether  individual  or  joint.  (
FC  §  
3552(a)).  If  a  dispute  regarding  income  exists,  the  
party  whose  income  is  in  dispute refuses to provide 
tax returns,  and  the  refusing  party  stands  to  benefit',

from the lack of proof of income, consider asking the 
court to take the motion off calendar or to deny the 
motion  in  its  entirety  for  failure  to  comply  with  
discovery requests. 
a.  No Fifth Amendment Right to Deny Access 
Tax   returns   requested   pursuant   to 
FC   § 
3552 may   not   be   denied   on   the basis   of   
the 5th Amendment,  subject  to  the  statutory 
requirements of   confidentiality. (
IRMO 
Sachs (2002) 95 Cal.App.4
th
 1144). 
B. REVIEWING PERSONAL TAX RETURNS  
The personal tax return is a useful tool because the return 
and its schedules and supporting documents should list a 
person’s  sources  of  income,  assets,  and  any  bases  that  a  
person may have to qualify for tax deductions. 
1. Tax  Return  Income  Presumptively  Correct  as  to  
a Parent’s Income 
A parent’s gross income, as stated under penalty of 
perjury    on    a    recent    tax    return,    should    be    
presumptively  correct.    (
IRMO  Loh (2001)  93 
Cal.App.4
th
 325; but also see IRMO Hein (2020) 52 
Cal.App.5th      519      regarding self-employment 
income/tax returns).  The presumption is persuasive 
because   tax   returns   are   ultimately   enforced   by   
federal  and  state  criminal  penalties,  but  it  is  not  
conclusive. 
2. Rebutting  the  Presumption 
This   presumption   may   be   successfully   rebutted   
where  the  obligor  has  made  inconsistent  income  
claims.
 Courts    have    looked    at    inconsistencies    
between a parent’s tax return and their Income and 
Expense  Declaration,  business  expense  statements,  
testimony,  and  loan  applications  as  bases  to  rebut  
the     presumption. (

C. FORM 1040:   OVERVIEW                 
Form 1040, which U.S. taxpayers use to file an annual 
individual  income  tax  return,  is  the  tax  return  that  
the LCSA attorney will most commonly review. The 
1040 was redesigned effective tax year 2022 and has 
been improved to categorize and identify sources of 
income. The IRS has also released a new alternative 
to  Form  1040  for  senior  taxpayers  (age  65  or  older)  
who  have  uncomplicated  finances.  See  Form  1040-
SR.  
An  average  Form  1040  may  contain  Schedules  1  
through  3  but  may  also  include  any  of  the  sixteen  
(16)  schedules  for  more  complex  tax  filings  that  
claim    certain    deductions    or    credits    or    owe    
additional taxes. 
1. Schedules 
The  following  are  the  schedules  that  may  need  to  
be  filed  with  the  redesigned  Form  1040  depending  
upon the type of deductions, credits, and obligation 
to pay additional taxes: 
a. Schedule   1   – Additional   Income   and   
Adjustments to Income 
b. Schedule 2   –   Additional Taxes 
c. Schedule   3   –   Additional   Credits   and

Reportable Income and Allowed Deductions 
IRC  §  61(a) defines  “gross  income”  similar  to  FC 
§   4058.   However,   not   all   sources   of   income   
available   for   child   support   are   required   to   be   
reported    on    Form    1040.    Additionally, when 
determining  the  annual  net  disposable  income  for  
calculating    child    support,    the    Family    Code’s    
definition  of  allowable  deductions  under  
FC  §  
4059 
is   different   from   the   deductions   allowed 
under the IRC.  Form  1040  can be  misleading  when  
used  as  the  only  source  for  determining  a party’s 
income,  which  is  why  a  holistic  analysis  of  the  
party’s  Income  and  Expense Declaration,  proof  of  
income,  and  tax  returns  is  the  best  practice  for  
determining income available for support. 
a. W-2 Income 
Form 1040-line  1a    requires  the  wage  earner  to  
report  the total  taxable  income  from  their  W-2 
at  Box  #1  (Taxable  Wages).  To  determine  gross  
earnings available for support, however, review 
Box   #3   (Social   Security   Wages)   and   Box   #5   
(Medicare  wages).  The higher  number  should 
be   used   for   calculating   support,   which   will   
include not only the taxable wages but also the 
elective  deferrals  to  retirement  plans,  pretax  
benefits, and/or payroll deductions.

Line   9   of   Form   1040   reports   total   income,   
including the  Schedule  1  income  reported  on  
line    8.    Schedule    1    income    includes    self-
employment     income,      partnership      or      S      
corporation income, unemployment 
compensation, rental income, and capital gains, 
including any additional income from Schedule 
1.  Schedule  1,  line  9  reports  the  total  amount  of  
additional    income    that    is    not    from    W-2, 
retirement,  interest,  dividend,  or  capital  gain.  
Note, line 3 reflects business income or loss, but 
the
 amount shown as net business income or 
loss is often not the amount of income available 
for support. The attached Schedule C contains a 
more  detailed  explanation  of  the  gross  receipts  
and  expenditures  for  the  business  and  requires 
analysis. (See subsection E below.) 
D. SCHEDULE A –   ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS  
Schedule  A  is  used  to  report  itemized  deductions.  
Taxpayers  generally  take  the  larger  of  their  itemized  
deductions or the standard deduction to reduce federal 
tax  liability.  The  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (TCJA),  which',

remains in effect through 2025, has impacted a number 
of  factors  that  parties  consider  when  determining  to  
take   the   standard   deduction   or   to   itemize   their   
deductions.  Itemized  deductions  include  medical  and  
dental   expenses,   amounts   paid   for   state   and   local   
income  or  sales  taxes  and  real  estate  taxes  (up  to  
$10,000/year),  mortgage  interest,  and  gifts  to  charity. 
Effective  January  1, 2022,    taxpayers   can   no   longer 
claim    qualified   mortgage   insurance   premiums,   and   
taxpayers  must  itemize  their  deductions  if  they  wish  to  
claim     charitable     contributions.     Additionally,     the     
standard mileage rate allowed for operating expenses for 
a car has changed throughout 2022.   
1. Analysis 
Add the actual cash outflow as stated in the Schedule 
A deductions and compare it to the party’s I&E. 
a. Does  the  actual  outflow  exceed  the  stated  
monthly income? 
b. Is there enough income left for non-tax items 
such as food, transportation, clothing, etc.? 
E. SCHEDULE   B – INTEREST   AND   ORDINARY   
DIVIDENDS                  
Interest and dividends are included in the definition of 
income.  (
FC  §  4058(a)(1)).  Interest  income  may  be  
based  on  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on  an  investment.  
(IRMO Scheppers (2001)  86 Cal.App.4
th
  646; IRMO 
Williams (2007)  150  Cal.App.4
th
  1221).  Dividends  are  
distributions   of   property   by   a   corporation   to   its   
shareholders.  Tax  returns  showing  significant  interest  
and ordinary dividend income may be indicative of an 
obligor   voluntarily   diverting   income   and   financial   
resources   to   capital   assets   at   the   expense   of   child   
support. 
 
 
F. SCHEDULE    C    – BUSINESS    INCOME    AND

 NOTE: The I&E requires that a self-employed  party  
attach   either   a   profit   and   loss   statement   for   the   
preceding  2  years,  or  the  Schedule  C  from  the  party’s  
last   federal   income   tax   return.   A   profit   and   loss   
statement    should    be    analyzed    with    the    same    
methodology   as   the   Schedule   C.      Profit   and   loss   
statements  are  frequently  prepared  specifically  for  the  
child support litigation and have nominal value. 
1. General Assessment 
Begin  by  looking  at  several  context  clues  to  assess  
an obligor’s business.  
a. What  industry  or  primary  business  activity  is  
this business related to? 
b. What type of accounting does this business use? 
(Cash vs. Accrual accounting) 
c. What   level   of   investment   or   expenses   is   the   
obligor putting into this business?  
d. Are there opportunities for personal expenses or 
assets  to  be  comingled  with  the  reported  assets  
and expenses of the business? 
2. Income  Available  for  Child  Support 
Many  business  owners  structure  their  income  and  
expenses  to  minimize  the  reporting  of  net  profit,  
using  proper  IRS  and  accounting  methods,  thereby  
reducing the amount of taxable income. 
An  obligor  may  not  structure  their  business  income  
and  expenses  in  such  a  way  that  would  seek  to  
minimize child support obligations.  (IRMO Chakko 
(2004)  115  Cal.App.4
th
 104). 
While  tax  laws  and  accounting  principles  allow  for  
the  use  of  depreciation  to  reduce  a  person’s  taxable  
obligation,   the   statutes   and   principles   governing   
child  support  are  more  stringent,  and  only  permit  
deductions that are: 
• Ordinary, necessary, and required;',

3. Part I –   Income 
For purposes of   support calculations, income derived 
from  a  business  as  reported  on  a  Schedule  C  is  
determined  by  adding  the  amount  of  gross  receipts  
reduced   by   the   expenditures   required   for   the   
operation of the business. (
FC § 4058(a)(2)). 
The  Cost  of  Goods  Sold  (“COGS”)  is  calculated  in  
Part  III  of  Schedule  C  and  is  an  indication  of  the  
minimum  necessary  costs  to  produce  or  acquire  the  
product  that  a  business  uses  to  generate  income.  
This   mandatory   cost   is   deducted   in   Part   I   of   
Schedule  C  before  Business  Expenses  are  deducted  
in Part II. 
4. Part II - Expenses 
IRS  rules  require  a  business  expense to   be  both 
ordinary and necessary. “Ordinary” is defined as an 
expense   that   is   common   and   accepted   in   the   
industry.   “Necessary”   is   defined   as   one   that   is   
helpful  and  appropriate  for  the  trade  or  business.  
The   expense   need   not   be   indispensable to   be 
considered   necessary   under   IRS   rules.   (See IRS 
Publication    535    Business    Expenses.)    For    child    
support   purposes,   however,   expenses   must   be 
“required” for the operation of   the business.” (
FC § 
4058(a)(2)).   In   the   face   of   an   ambiguity   as   to   
whether  disputed  sums  represent  income available 
for  support,  or    reasonable business  expenses,  the  
trial courts have discretion. (IRMO Blazer (2009) 176 
Cal.App.4

 1438).',

Case  law  further  highlights  the  need  to  construe  
business     expense     deductions     narrowly     and     
specifically  as  part  of  an  effort  to  support  public  
policy  to  ensure  the  payment  of  adequate  child  
support.     (Asfaw     v.     Woldberhan (2007)     147

a. Critical Thinking: A Profitable Business 
In  reviewing  expenses,  the  LCSA  should  review  
Part  II  with  a  focus  on  how  each  expenditure  
benefits  the  business  in  its  overall  goal  to  be  a  
profitable  venture.  For  example,  if  the  business  
has  significant  expenses  for  vehicles,  travel,  and  
meals,  but  is  not  involved  in  an  industry  that  
requires  significant  expenses  in  these  categories  
to produce their good or service, these expenses 
may require in-depth review. 
b.  Adding Back 
When   reviewing   a   Schedule   C   to   determine   
income available for child support, add back any 
expenses that are not “reasonable and necessary” 
for  the  operation  of  the  business,  and  add  back  
any  expenses  that  result  in  the  reduction  of  the  
party’s  living  expenses  or  are  for  personal  use.  
Note   that   self-employment   income   may   also   
include self-employment benefits, including any 
reduction  in  living  expenses.  (
FC  §  4058(a)(3); 
see Section IV – Support E.7). 
When analyzing, ask the following: 
1) Is the same expense deducted on multiple 
lines, “double-dipping”? 
2) Is the expense reasonable and necessary? 
3) Are the amounts accurate or   inflated? 
4) Are personal expenses being deducted: car 
and truck, insurance, legal fees, travel, meals 
and entertainment, and utilities? 
5) Is  the  depreciation  an  actual  reduction  of',

cash to the business or a paper loss? 
c. Depreciation 
Although     deprecation     expenses     may     be     
deducted  from  income  for  tax  and  accounting  
purposes, the same is not necessarily true when 
income  is  being  used  to  determine  child  or  
spousal support obligations. 
The  following  question  should  be  asked:  Can  
the business be conducted without a deduction 
for  depreciation?  (Asfaw  v.  Woldberhan  (2007) 
147 Cal.App.4
th 
1407). 
If  the  depreciation  is  related  to  real  property,  
that  depreciation  is  classified  as  a  “paper  loss”  
and is irrelevant for child support purposes and 
should  be  reviewed  to  add  back  to  the  total  
income      available      for      support.      If      the      
depreciation   is   related   to   personal   business   
property, such as business tools or equipment, a 
court  may  consider  the  depreciation  of  those  
assets as appropriate. 
Whether  depreciation  is  a  reasonable  business  
expense  is  for  the  trial  court  to  decide.  (See 
IRMO Blazer (2009) 176 Cal.App.4
th
 1438). 
As  tax  and  accounting  principles  evolve,  so  
does  the  case  law  governing  depreciation  and  
calculation  of  child  support.  IRMO Hein (2020) 
52  Cal.App.5
th
  519 discusses  the  impact  of  a  
business  decision  to  use  Section  179  of  the  IRC  
to take the full depreciation value of an asset in 
the  same  year  that  they  acquire  the  business  
equipment.  This,  in  turn,  significantly  reduces  
the  amount  of  business  income  they  report  for  
taxes.   This   has   been   classified   as   a   paper   
expense    that    does    not    reflect    an    actual    
expenditure  that  impacts  the  income  available 
for support.

deductions  for  equipment  and  other  assets  
used  in  a  self-employed  parent’s  business. 
The    court    explained    that    the    “term    
‘expenditure’  describes  an  actual  outlay  of 
cash. Claiming  a  depreciation  deduction  
on an income tax return does not require an 
outlay  of  cash  and,  thus,  does  not  reduce  
the funds available for child support”.)
 
d. The Home Office 
The IRS provides basic requirements to qualify 
for the home office deduction and two commonly 
seen categories are:: 1) Exclusive and regular use 
of the space as the principal place of business; or  
2) Exclusive and regular space where the 
business meets or deals with clients in the normal 
course of business.  (See IRS Publication 587) 
Questions to ask: 
1) What  is  the  relative  importance  of  the  activities  
performed at the home in relation to any other place 
where business is conducted? 
2) Does  the  party  claim  a   mortgage  interest  in 
addition   to   a deduction   for   home   office 
space? 
3) Is  the  portion  of  the  home  used  exclusively  
for business? 
4)  Is the business deducting  personal expenses:',

utilities, telephone? 
5) Is the  home office space claiming 
depreciation? 
6) Can the business be conducted without the 
use of the home office space? 
e. Timing of Expense 
A business owner may elect to deduct the cost of 
certain  assets  on  their  income  tax  return  as  an  
expense, rather than requiring the cost of   the asset 
to  be  capitalized  and  depreciated  (Schedule  C,  
Line  13;  
26  USC  §  179).  This  asset  is  generally  
limited to tangible, depreciable, personal property 
which is acquired by purchase for use in the active 
conduct  of  a  trade  or  business.  Question  to  ask:  
Was  the  asset  expensed  actually  paid  for  in  the  
year claimed, or was it financed over time (e.g., on 
business line of credit or credit card)? 
f. Interest on Debt 
Analyze Schedule C,    Part II, line 16b as follows: 
1) What business purchases are associated with 
the interest deducted? 
2) Did the business deduct the entire price of   the 
claimed item in the tax year, but actually pay on 
it over time through a business line of credit or 
credit card? 
3) Did the business “expense” the entire asset in 
one   tax   year   under   Section   179   and   then   
depreciate it in a following tax year? 
5. Part III –   Costs of Goods Sold 
Costs of Goods Sold (COGS) are essentially anything 
that ultimately becomes part of   products that are sold 
or  distributed  to  customers.  Money  spent  on  raw  
materials,   packaging,   and   shipping   are   COGS.   
Because COGS can easily be manipulated, it is best to 
verify  that  they  are  ordinary  and  necessary  to  the  
trade or business, they are not for personal use, and 
the   costs   are   not   inflated.   Be   aware   of   possible',

“double-dipping.” 
a. Inventory 
To  calculate  COGS,  the  owner  will  need  the  
dollar  value  of  inventory  at  the  beginning  and  
end of the year. 
b. Analysis 
1) Is the business purchasing a   lot of   items but 
claiming a non-profitable business year? 
2) Did    the    business    sell    everything    it    
purchased? 
3) Where  is  the  profit  from  the  mark-up  on  
goods purchased and sold? 
4) Is  the  cost  of  labor  (line  37)  included  as  
commissions and fees on Line 10 or as wages 
on Line 26? 
5) If   labor   costs   incurred   by   the   business   
exceed  $600,  did  the  business  owner  file  the  
required Miscellaneous 1099? 
6) Are  the  wages  paid  to  employees  higher  
than the business owner’s income? 
7) Are there relatives or   other people in a   non- 
business  relationship  with  the  owner  on  the  
payroll? 
6. Part IV –   Business Use of a Vehicle 
If  a  vehicle  is  used  for  business,  the  amount  of  use  
for business must be listed to determine the division 
of  expenses  for  business  and  personal  purposes.  A 
business  can  either  claim  actual  expenses,  which  
includes parking fees and tolls, interest on a vehicle 
loan, vehicle registration fees, personal property tax 
on  a  vehicle,  lease  and  rental  expenses,  insurance,  
fuel  and  gasoline,  repairs,  oil  changes,  tires,  routine  
maintenance, and depreciation, (but not commuting 
expense,)  or  it  can  claim  the  standard  mileage  rate,  
which  amount  varies  yearly.  As  of  January  01,  2023  
the  rate  has  increased  to  65.5  cents  per  mile. See

a. Analysis 
Analyze  whether  the  vehicle  expense  should  be  
added   back,   just   as   you   would   with   other   
business expenses. Questions to ask: 
1) Is the expense reasonable and necessary? 
2) Are the amounts accurate or   inflated? 
3) Are     personal     expenses     also     being     
deducted? 
4) Is the vehicle being depreciated? 
5) Are commuting miles being deducted? 
7. Net Profit 
Review the net profit as a percentage of   gross receipts 
to  determine  whether  the  net  profit  is  reasonable.  
Where cases warrant, look to industry standards for 
rate    of    return    and    gross    profit    margin.    See 
https://www.bls.gov 
8. Business Records 
The IRS does not require special record-keeping, but 
they  do  require  that  a  business  be  able  to  identify  
sources  of  income  and  prove  deductible  expenses  
reported on their tax return. Records of   employment 
taxes  must  be  kept  for  at  least  4  years.  Therefore,  if  
necessary, request documentation to substantiate the 
income and expenses claimed in Schedule C. 
9. Earning  Capacity 
Look at  obligor’s  earning history in  relationship to 
the earnings reported through the business. If a self- 
employed individual is earning less than what he/she 
earned as a W-2 employee in the same industry, you 
may  want  to  request  imputation  of    income.  (See 
Section IV     - Support). Statistics  regarding 
“reasonable compensation”     may    be found at

The Schedule D form is used to report capital gains and 
losses that  result  from  the  sale  or  trade  of  certain  
property  during  the  year.  Capital  assets  include  all  
personal property and investment assets. When a capital 
asset that was held for personal use is sold at a gain, any 
money  gained  must  be  reported  and  is  considered  as  
income  for  purposes  of  calculating  support.  However,  
any    increase    in    the    value    of    marketable,    but    
unliquidated   assets,   is   not   considered   income   for

Form  8949  (Sales  and  Other  Dispositions  of  Capital  
Assets)  is  an  itemization  of  every  transaction  that  
occurred  during  the  tax  year.  The  total  aggregate  is  
entered on Schedule D. Analyze Form 8949 to ensure 
the transactions reported qualify as capital gains and 
losses or   whether income has accrued that should be 
considered  in  child  support  calculations.  See IRS 
Publication 550 (Investment Income and Expenses at 
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf). When 
analyzing  capital  gains  and  losses,  use  a  cost-basis 
analysis   (the   cost   of   the   asset   when   purchased   
compared with the sales price when sold). 
2. Sale of a   Business 
Cash received from the sale of a business is a capital 
asset. If the cash is not reinvested as capital but used 
for living expenses, the court has discretion to assign 
a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on  the  amount  received.  
(IRMO  Destein (2001)  91  Cal.App.4
th
  1385).  If  the  
obligor  sells  the  business  and  reinvests  in  another  
income-producing  asset,  the  money  from  the  sale  is  
not  income  for  calculating  child  support,  but  the  
replacement of one capital asset with another. 
3. Increased  Equity  in   Home 
The   reasonable   rate   of   return   analysis   does   not   
extend to increased equity in a party’s home. (IRMO

4. Deferring  Compensation 
If  an  obligor  voluntarily  defers  compensation  to  
invest  in  his  or  her  business  at  the  expense  of  his  
support  obligation,  the  deferred  income  should  be  
used in calculating support. (IRMO Berger (2009) 170

 1070). 
5. Selling  a   Profitable  Business 
A  court  may  impute  income  to  an  obligor  who  
chooses to sell a company at a   large profit and invest 
in new companies which would predictably operate 
at  a  loss  for  the  near  term.  (IRMO  Sorge (2012)  202  
Cal.App.4

H. SCHEDULE E – SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME AND 
LOSS 
Rental  income  is  any  payment  received  for  the  use  or  
occupation of property. Taxable rental income includes 
the gross income received as rent, minus the expenses of 
renting   the   property.   For   child   support   purposes,   
analyze  rental  income  as  you  would  business  income.  
Add back any expenses that are not reasonable or   are for 
the obligor’s personal benefit. 
1. Analysis 
Is  the  net  effect  of  the  rental  to  show  current  losses  
(or   minimal   gains),   while   at   the   same   time   the   
owner/defendant of the property is increasing his/her 
equity   so   that   after   the   child   emancipates,   the   
owner/defendant   will   own   a   valuable   piece   of   
property without encumbrance? 
2. Adding  Back 
Add  back  any  expenses  that  are  not  reasonable  or  
that are for the obligor’s personal benefit. 
a. Is the property a   true rental, or only portrayed 
that way for tax purposes? 
b. Are the expenses reasonable and necessary? 
c. Are    the    repairs    legitimate,    or    are    they    
improvements to enhance the equity and value 
of the property?',

d. Were the repairs and/or maintenance actually 
done on the rental property, or   on the owner’s 
residence? 
e. Are  there  personal  expenses  mingled-in  with  
rental property expenses? 
f. Is there excessive auto mileage claimed? 
g. Is    the    rent    charged    fair    market    value?    
(Sometimes  the  obligor  will  rent  at  a  reduced  
rate to a relative or a friend). 
3. Depreciation 
Depreciation  of  rental  property  is  not  allowed  and  
should   be   added   back   as   income.   (Asfaw   v.   
Woldberhan (2007)  147  Cal.App.4
th
  1407).  Consider  
adding the rental property depreciation claimed back 
in as non-taxable gross income. If the rental property 
depreciation is input as taxable gross income, it has 
the effect of giving a tax benefit to the obligor for an 
otherwise  fictional  paper  loss  and  thus  minimizing  
the actual income available for child support. 
4. Reasonable  Rate  of  Return 
The  court  has  the discretion  to  impute  a  reasonable  
rate of return to the investment property even if it is 
non-income  producing.  (IRMO  Destein  (2001)  91  
Cal.App.4
th
  1385).  However,  it  may  be  an  abuse  of  
discretion to impute a rate of return on home equity 
absent a showing of   special circumstances rendering 
the   guideline   amount   unjust   or   inappropriate.   
(IRMO Williams (2007) 150 Cal.App.4
th
 1221). 
5. Primary  Residence 
Untapped equity in a primary residence is generally 
not  income  for  support  purposes.  (IRMO  Henry  
(2005) 126 Cal.App.4
th
 111).  
6. “Special  Circumstances” 
The court may find special circumstances to deviate 
upward   from   the   guideline   support   calculation   
pursuant  to  
FC  §  4057(b)(5)(C)  if  an  obligor  has  
extensive  property  holdings  that  do  not  produce  
income.   (IRMO   de   Guigne   (2002)   97   Cal.App.4

I. SCHEDULE    F    – PROFIT    OR    LOSS    FROM    
FARMING 
Analyzing  a  Schedule  F  parallels  the  analysis  of  the  
Schedule C. 
1. Depreciation 
Depreciating  farm  assets  is  common  and  generally  
necessary to promote the continuity of the business. 
While California has no specific case law addressing 
whether to include or exclude depreciation expenses 
for farm equipment, other jurisdictions have allowed 
its   inclusion   depending   upon   the   circumstances   
presented,  with  the  trial  court  having  the  ultimate  
say.  Use  the  same  depreciation  analysis  as  set  forth  
above when analyzing Schedule F depreciation. 
J. BUSINESS ENTITY TAX RETURNS  
If   a   business   elects   to   operate   in   a   more   complex   
manner, the LCSA may encounter a legal structure that 
serves to distinguish the owner from the business. Each 
business  entity  has  its  own  rules  for  reporting  income  
and utilizes different tax forms.  
Common  business  structures  are  Partnerships,  Limited  
Liability  Companies,  and  Corporations.  Therefore,  the  
initial  task  of  the  LCSA  attorney  is  to  determine  what  
type of business entity they are encountering and what 
associated  documents  they  need  to  seek  to  obtain  the 
necessary  financial  information  to  determine  income  
available for support. 
1. Compensation 
Each  business  entity  must  report  the  amount  of  net  
earnings  generated  by  the  business,  as  well  as  the  
way  the  earnings  are  attributed  to  the  members  of  
the business. Depending on the business structure, a 
business   member   may   receive   income   from   the   
business  through  profit-sharing,  wages,  benefits,  or  
a combination of methods.

299 
 
 
The type of tax return filed for a business depends 
on the type of business entity: 
• Form 1065 – U.S. Return of Partnership Income  
A   Partner’s   Share   of   Income,   Deductions,   and   
Credits is reported on Form 1065, Schedule K 1. This 
amount will also appear on Schedule E of Form 1040. 
• Form 1120 – U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return 
Corporate    earnings    are    typically    reported    as    
dividends on Form 1099-DIV. 
• Form  1120-S  –    U.S.  Income  Tax  Return  for  an  S  
Corporation 
An  S-  Corporation  involves  passthrough  taxation,  
and  the  Shareholders  of  the  corporation’s  Share  of  
Income,   Deductions,   and   Credits   is   reported   on   
Form  1120-S  K-1.  This  amount  will  also  appear  on  
Schedule E of Form 1040. 
K. THE CORPORATION AND FORM 1120  
A  corporation  is  a  legal  and  tax  entity  by  itself,  which  
must  file  a  corporate  tax  return  (Form  1120)  and  pay  
taxes  at  the  corporate  level.  The  corporation  serves  to  
limit the liability of the owner or owners to the amount 
of their investment in the corporation. 
Small   business   owners   will   incorporate   to   protect   
personal assets. In these cases, a corporate return can be 
analyzed  similar  to  a  Schedule  C  under  an  “alter  ego”  
theory. Questions to ask: 
• Do the corporation and the party comingle funds 
and other assets? 
• Does the party treat the corporation as his/her 
own, paying personal debts with corporate funds? 
• Who controls distributions? 
• Are there monetary reserves that have not been 
distributed that should be considered as income? 
• Does the corporation issue stock? 
• Does the corporation maintain corporate 
records? 
• Are there corporate officers? Who are they? 
• Is the location of the corporation the same as the 
party’s personal residence?',

• Is the corporation adequately capitalized? 
1. Personal  Income 
Income  distributed  to  the  officers,  owners,  and/or  
shareholders  of  a  corporation  is  also  taxed  and  is  
considered personal income. It is listed on Form 1120 
as  “Compensation  of  Officers.”  You  will  need  to  
know  how  many  owners/shareholders  are  involved  
in the corporation to determine personal income. 
2. Analysis 
a. Compare the Form 1120 corporate tax returns 
and   schedules   to   the   party’s   personal   tax   
returns. 
b. Ascertain   who   controls   distributions   and   
whether  the  corporation  maintains  monetary  
reserves that have not been distributed and if 
so, that should be considered as income. 
c. Consider  requesting  articles  of  incorporation,  
corporate bylaws, corporate records, financial 
statements, and bank records. 
3. Discovery  of  Corporate  Returns 
Corporate   tax   returns   regarding   a   shareholder   
spouse   are   properly   discoverable.   However,   any   
information regarding the private financial affairs of 
non-parties    must    be    carefully    balanced    before    
ordering   disclosure.   (Schnabel   v.   Superior   Court   
(1993) 5 Cal.4
th
 704). 
L. THE   S   CORPORATION:   FORM   1120   S   AND   
PASS-THROUGH TAXATION 
 
 
An “S” Corporation is a form of corporation that meets 
specific IRS requirements. It gives a corporation with 100 
shareholders  or  less  the  benefit  of  incorporation  while  
being taxed as a partnership. Income is passed directly 
to   shareholders   to   avoid   double   taxation.   An   “S”   
Corporation  files  an  informational  return  reporting  its  
gross income (or loss) and deductions, its shareholders, 
and the shareholders’ pro rata shares of each item (IRS 
Form    1120S    U.S.    Income    Tax    Return    for    an    S    
Corporation). (

1. Section 1: Income 
Similar   to   the   Schedule   C   for   a   self-employed 
individual,   the   gross   profit   of   the   business   is   
determined   by   taking   the   gross   receipts   of   the   
business, subtracting the Cost of Goods Sold (if any) 
and  assessing  any  additional  income  or  loss  of  the  
business. 
2. Section 2: Deductions 
Here,    the    LCSA    attorney    may    find    valuable    
information  regarding  a  person’s  compensation,  as  
an S corporation must pay their corporate officers a 
reasonable  rate  of  pay,  listed  on  line  7,  and  if  the  S  
corporation  has  any  employees,  those  salaries  and  
wages  will  be  listed  on  line  8.  A  corporate  officer  
can  also  be  an  employee,  so  these  earnings  need  to  
be compared with the party’s personal tax return. 
This   section   also   provides   an   opportunity   to 
scrutinize for comingling of corporate and personal 
expenses, especially in the “other deductions” listed 
on   line   19.      Given   that   S   corporations   are   a   
passthrough  entity,  the  typical  S  corporation  will  
attempt to maximize the advantages of this business 
entity  by  using  their  deductions  to  reduce  their  
income,  resulting  in  ordinary  business  income  (or  
loss)  on  line  21  that  is  significantly  less  than  the  
total income initially reported on line 6. 
The  IRS  allows  for  significant  business  deductions  
related  to  meals,  travel,  and  non-essential  business  
expenses,  therefore,  the  statement  related  to  line  19  
can  be  scrutinized  for  deductions  to  “add  back”  to  
the overall income available for support.  
The tax benefits of a lower reported taxable income 
on  a  shareholder’s  Schedule  K-1  may  also  be  a  
factor that is persuasive in determining the amount 
of income available for support.

• Review   the   Ordinary   Business   Income   (or

expenditures  that  may  not  be  essential  or  excessive  
for the business. 
• Review  for  any  Section  179  deductions  that  
are flowing to the shareholder’s personal tax return 
on  line  11.  Are  these  purchases  that  qualify  for  
Section  179  deductions  wholly  business  expenses?    
Analyze  for  equipment,  furniture,  computers  off-
the-shelf  software,  or  vehicles  that  may  provide

M. THE  LIMITED  LIABILITY  COMPANY:  IS  IT  A  
PARTNERSHIP OR A CORPORATION? 
 
 
A   limited   liability   company   (LLC)   is   a   business 
structure where the members of the company cannot be 
held   personally   liable   for   the   company’s   debts   or   
liability.
 LLC’s are essentially hybrid entities that 
combine   the   characteristics   of   a   corporation   and   a   
partnership  or  sole  proprietorship.  Like  partnerships,  
the  LLC  itself  is  not  a  separate  taxable  entity.  LLC  
owners   report   business   profits   or   losses   on   their   
personal income tax returns; the business itself does not 
pay   tax   on   this   money.   LLCs   may   file   the   same   
informational  tax  return  with  the  IRS  as  partnerships  
(Form    1065)    and    distribute    the    same    schedules    
(Schedule   K-1,   which   lists   each   owner’s   share   of   
income).  Alternatively,  LLC  owners  can  elect  to  have  
their  LLC  taxed  like  a  corporation.  Depending  on  how  
the LLC is taxed, review the section on the partnerships 
or corporations above.

proprietorships (self-employment income), 
partnerships,   S   corporations,   and   some   trusts   and   
estates (
26 USC §   199A). The Qualified Business Income 
(QBI) deduction allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up 
to 20 percent of their QBI. In most cases, QBI is the net 
proceeds  from  the  operation  of  a  business  or  Schedule  
K-1  income  distributed  by  a  pass-through  entity.  QBI  
does not include income that is not directly connected to 
the  operation  of  the  business  (e.g.  investment  income  
such as capital gains or   losses or dividends, and interest 
income not properly allocable to a trade or   business) and 
W-2 income paid by the business. 
The   QBI   deduction   is   also   available   against   rental   
income if the rental activity is operated in the form of   a 
business  with  sufficient  regularity  and  investment  of  
time and effort. A safe harbor is available to individuals 
and  owners  of  passthrough  entities  who  seek  to  claim  
the  QBI  deduction  with  respect  to  a  rental  real  estate  
business see IRS         Notice         2019-07         at         
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-19-07.pdf.   The IRS

finalizing the limited safe harbor initially documented in 
IRS  Notice  2019-07. See https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs- 
drop/rp-19-38.pdf. 
The  QBI  deduction  is  claimed  against  personal  taxable  
income   in   addition   to   the standard deduction   or 
itemized  deduction  claimed  by  the taxpayer.  Thus,  it 
provides
 a significant amount of additional tax 
deduction  reducing  the  tax  liability  and  increasing  net  
disposable   income   available   for   support.   You   can 
determine  the  amount  of    the  QBI  deduction  claimed 
from line 13 of   IRS Form 1040 or calculate the amount of 
the deduction  based  on  the business  type,  business 
income,   taxable   income,   W-2 wages paid   by   the 
business,  unadjusted  basis  of    qualified  property  and 
whether the business is a   qualified or   specified business.

O. SCHEDULE K – PARTNERSHIP TAX RETURNS 
A  partnership  files  a  Schedule  K-1  (IRS  Form  1065)  to  
report  each  partner’s  share  of  the  partnership  income  
or  loss,  deductions,   and  credits  for  the  tax  year.  Each  
partner  is  also  required  to  file  their  own  personal  tax  
return,  which  should  reflect  the  net  income  derived  
from the partnership. 
1. Discovery  
Request the partnership’s tax returns, along with 
the party’s individual tax return to help ascertain 
available income for child support. 
2. Cash Distributions  
Many partnerships maintain cash reserves 
without distributing income to partners to 
capitalize on the partnership. If cash distributions 
are made to the individual partners, those 
distributions may not be reflected as income on a 
party’s personal tax returns, (unless the 
distribution is in excess of a previously defined 
basis,) but the distribution will show on line 19 of 
the Schedule K-1. 
3. Analysis 
a. Compare   how   much   income   the   partner   
reports  he/she  received  to  the  amount  he/she  
could have received. 
b. Consider   whether   the   partner’s   share   of   
monetary    reserves,    or    other    holdings    not    
distributed to the partner, should be deemed as 
income for child support calculations.  
c. Obtain    the    partnership    agreement    and    
terms,   related   business   records,   as   well   as   
financial     documentation     (especially     bank

exist  and/or  who  controls  distributions  to  the

Where  the  confidentiality  and  financial  privacy  
rights  of  third-party  partners  are  at  issue,  the  
court  may  be  required  to  balance  the  privacy  
rights   of   the   third-parties   with   the   need   for   
disclosure  of  the  financial  information  (Schnabel 
v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4

the   court   with   less   intrusive   alternatives   to

1. Formal Proceedings 
While  some  informality  and  flexibility  have  been  
allowed in family law proceedings, the same rules of 
evidence  apply  as  in  other  civil  actions.  (
FC  §  210; 
Elkins v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4
th
 1337). 
2. Testimony 
Courts     must     receive     “any     live,     competent     
testimony.”  (
FC  §  217; IRMO  Shimkus  (2016)  244  
Cal.App.4
th
  1262)  This  live  testimony  requirement  
not only applies to contested trials but also includes 
hearings  on  any  order  to  show  cause  or  notice  of  
motion  brought  pursuant  to  the Family  Code.  (
FC 
§ 217(a)
); but see 3(b) below. 
If the LCSA attorney seeks to compel attendance of a 
party    to    a    hearing    or    trial    and    additional    
information  is  required  from  the  party  that  has  not  
been   gathered   pre-motion,   consider   issuing   the   
Notice  to  Appear  and  Produce.  If  served  at  least  20  
days before the required attendance and production, 
the Notice has the same effect as a subpoena and the 
same    consequences    for    noncompliance    as    a    
subpoena.  See  CCP  1987  regarding  issuance  and  
effect of a notice to appear in lieu of a subpoena. See 
CCP  1991  for  consequences  for  disobedience  to  a  
subpoena.  It  may  be  appropriate  to  file  a  motion  to  
compel  the  production  before  seeking  a  contempt  
finding. 
 NOTE: CSE does not save a viewable copy of the 
Notice  to  Appear  and  Produce  when  generated.  If 
you  wish  to  keep  a  copy  for  reference  or  potential  
later  use,  you  will  need  to  upload  an  image  of  the  
Notice when you issue it.

testimony  and  shall  state  its  reasons  for  the  
finding on the record or in writing.” (FC § 217(b); 
Chalmers  v.  Hirschkop  (2013)  213  Cal.App.4th 
289,  313  [trial  court  decision  not  to  hear  live  
testimony from 10-year-old child upheld]). CRC 
5.113(b) lists the following good cause factors:
 
1) Whether a   substantive matter is at issue; 
2) Whether material facts are in controversy; 
3) Whether live testimony is necessary to assess 
credibility of the parties or other witnesses; 
4) The    parties’    right    to    question    anyone    
submitting  reports  or  other  information  to  
the court; 
5) Whether the parties have filed and served a 
non-party witness list in compliance with FC 
§   217(c);  and 
6) Any other factor that is just and equitable. 
 
JUDICIAL   NOTICE:   Certain   facts   may   meet   the   
criteria  for  the  court  to  take  judicial  notice  without  
requiring testimony or other evidence to prove the fact. 
Judicial  notice  is  only  available  under  the  law  when  
certain requirements are met. There are two basic forms 
of    judicial    notice    -    mandatory    and    permissive. 
Mandatory  judicial notice  is  identified  in  the  Evidence  
Code    (
EC § 451).    Permissive    judicial    notice    is    
discussed  in  
EC §  452.   The  process  for  requesting 
judicial notice under 
EC § 452 is set forth in EC § 453. 
There is  a   notice  component  to  making  such  a  request  
and  the  non-requesting  party  is  to  be  afforded  the  
opportunity to respond as set forth in 
EC § 455. 
4. Declarations 
Pursuant  to  
CCP  §  2015.5,  written  declarations,  
whether executed inside or outside California, must 
be made under penalty of   perjury. If executed outside 
California, the declaration  must  state:  “I  certify  (or 
declare)  under  penalty  of  perjury  under  the  laws  of  
the State of California that the foregoing is true and',

correct.”  (Kulshrestha  v.  First  Union  Commercial  
Corp. (2004) 33 Cal.4
th
 601, 618). 
A party may attempt to offer a   declaration in place of 
live  testimony  from  a  third  party.  Declarations  are  
typically  permitted  in  law  and  motion  proceedings  
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2009. At trial, 
however, a   declaration is generally not admissible as 
evidence due to the hearsay rule.  An LCSA attorney 
should  be  prepared  to  elicit  live  testimony  from  a  
case manager or other custodian of   records if there is 
a need to introduce a record from the agency.  
 NOTE:  Even  if  declarations  are  properly  signed  
under  penalty  of  perjury,  they  may  be  inadmissible  
on other grounds. (
FC § 217; Elkins v. Superior Court 
(2007)  41 Cal.4
th
  1337 [Local  rule  requiring  a  trial 
court  to  receive  written  declarations  in  evidence  in  
lieu   of   direct   testimony   was   invalid   because   it   
conflicted with the hearsay rule]). 
 
EXHIBITS: Some  courts  may  require  service  and  
filing (or lodging) of exhibits in   advance  of a trial. 
See  your  local  rules  concerning  such  requirements. 
Deadlines  for  the  exchange  of  exhibits  may  also  be  
set during the trial setting hearing.  It is a good idea 
to   meet   and   confer   with   opposing   counsel   to   
determine  if  there  are  any  agreements  concerning  
the admissibility  of  proposed  exhibits.   This  would  
save time during the   contested hearing.  If no prior 
exchange  of  exhibits  is  required  by  your  court,  be  
prepared  to  have  enough  copies  of  exhibits  for  all  
parties or their counsel and for the court.  It may be 
appropriate  to  provide  an  extra  copy  to  the  court 
for note-taking.   If there is no agreement concerning 
the admissibility  of  the  exhibits,  be  prepared  to  
obtain  testimony  concerning  the authenticity  and 
content of the exhibits from a witness who can show 
a basis for their knowledge of the document.

Prior  to  the  hearing,  parties  who  seek  to  introduce  
live  testimony  from  non-party  witnesses  must  file  
and serve a witness list with a   brief description of   the 
anticipated testimony. (
FC §   217(c)). If the non-party 
witness list is not served before the hearing, the court 
may, on request, grant a   brief continuance, and make 
appropriate temporary orders pending the continued 
hearing. 
 NOTE: Witnesses  may  still  be  allowed  to  testify  
even if no witness list has been served, however the 
court  may  require  an  offer  of  proof  before  it  allows  
any nonparty witness to testify.  (
CRC 5.113(e)). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Considering  the  live  testimony  
requirements  of  FC  §  217  and Elkins,  LCSA  attorneys  
may  need  to  issue  subpoenas  for  non-party  witnesses  
to   get   their   live   testimony   before the court.   For 
example,  a  custodial  party  that  is  a  guardian  and  not  
named  as  a  party  to  the  action.   The  process  to  do  this 
is  a  subpoena.  (CCP  §  1985).  An  attorney  of  record 
can sign  and issue  a  subpoena.  To  compel  a  witness 
to  attend trial they  must  be  a  resident  of  California  at 
the  time  of  service  and  have  been  personally  served.  
(CCP  §  1985, 1987, 1989).  It  is  timely  served  if  it’s  
served in    enough time    to    allow    the    witness    a 
reasonable  time  for  preparation  and  travel  to  the  place 
of  attendance,  otherwise  there  is  not  a  specific  amount 
of days’  notice required. (CCP § 1987(a)). 
 
 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   Consider   whether   to   request   
exclusion  of  non-party  witnesses  from  the  hearing  until  
they  are  called  to  testify,  to  avoid  prejudice  to  any  party  
that  may  be  caused  by  the  witness  overhearing  other  
testimony  and conforming  their  own testimony  to  what 
is heard. (EC § 777). 
6. Offers  of  Proof 
While unsworn statements made by an attorney are 
not evidence (County of Alameda v. Moore (1995) 33 
Cal.App.4
th
  1422,  1426),  an  attorney  may  make  an  
offer of proof. 
An offer of   proof is a statement by counsel describing 
proposed  evidence  and  what  counsel  intends  to',

prove if the proposed evidence is admitted. (Gordon 
v.  Nissan  Motor  Co.,  Ltd.  (2009)  170  Cal.App.4
th
 
1103, 1113). 
Example: “If   called   to   testify   Child   Support   
Specialist Jane Smith will testify that Respondent 
spoke with a LCSA CSS on 10/5/13. That CSS went 
over the current child support order in detail with 
him.  All  of  this  is  made  as  an  offer  of  proof  that  
Respondent had knowledge of the order.” 
Failure  to  make  a  sufficient  offer  of  proof  on  the  
record could preclude you from raising the issue on 
appeal should the trial court exclude your proffered 
evidence.  (
EC  §  354(a); Gordon  v.  Nissan  Motor  
Co., Ltd., supra, at 1113). 
7. Birth  Certificates 
A certified copy of a birth certificate is admissible as 
prima   facie   evidence   of   facts   contained   therein.   
(
H&S § 103550). 
8. Genetic  Test  Results 
Absent  a  timely  filed  written  objection,  genetic  test  
results   must   be   admitted   without   the   need   for   
foundational testimony. (
FC § 7552.5(b)). 
9. Credibility 
The  trial  court  has  broad  power  to  determine  the  
credibility    of    testimony    and    evidence.    (IRMO 
Calcaterra and Badakhsh (2005) 132 Cal.App.4
th
 28). 
B. OBJECTIONS GENERALLY  
1. Reasonable Control 
It  is  the  court’s  duty  to  exercise  reasonable  control  
over the interrogation of witnesses, find the truth to 
quickly  and  effectively  and  to  protect  the  witnesses 
from  undue  harassment  or  embarrassment.  (
EC  §  
765).

probative  value  is  substantially  outweighed  by  the  
probability that its admission will necessitate undue 
consumption  of  time,  or  it  will  create  substantial  
danger  of  undue  prejudice  or  confuse  the  issues  
before the court. (
EC § 352). 
3. Objections  at  Trial 
Generally, an objection must be made at the time the 
statement is made. (
EC § 353). 
4. The  Hearsay  Rule 
One of   the   most   frequently   cited   objections   is   
hearsay.  Evidence of   an out of   court statement made 
by someone other than the witness testifying, which 
is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, is 
considered      hearsay. Hearsay      evidence      is      
inadmissible  unless  it  falls  into  one  of  the  many  
recognized   exceptions   to   the   hearsay   rule   (see   
Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule below).  (
