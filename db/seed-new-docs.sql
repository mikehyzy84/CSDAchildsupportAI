Good afternoon,   
This email is to serve as a reminder regarding the agency’s Case Conflict of Interest and Reporting 
Policy. This agency has a responsibility to safeguard all case information. There are Federal and State 
requirements that must be followed to ensure case and participant information is not compromised 
and that information is accessed based on a business need to do so. If you have a case conflict of 
interest, you are to complete the Case Conflict of Interest Reporting Form and turn it into your 
supervisor. Details and instructions, including the form, are outlined in the Case Conflict of Interest 
Reporting Policy located on the intranet: [Link to policy]
 
 
You are expected to adhere to this policy, which includes following the protocol for reporting a case  
conflict violation. The system tracks worker activity within a case, whether or not a case activity  note 
is entered. Additionally, the system tracks attempted access to cases that you have been conflicted out 
of. If you try to access a conflict case, you will see the following page in the system: 
 
If there is an attempt to access a case you have been locked out of, you must report it immediately   to 
your supervisor. If your supervisor is not available, you must report it to your manager. If they are not  
available, you must report it to someone of authority, such as another supervisor or manager. You  
must send an email informing them of the violation. If you have the information, include the case  
number and/or participant ID, and the situation or reason you were trying to access the case. If your  
reason for attempting to access the case is due to working a document or piece of mail, you must  
give the supervisor and/or manager the document or mail at the time you report the incident to them.',

responsibility for the child(ren). • A court order that awards custodial periods of time, or visitation, does not control the  
 
calculation of timeshare; rather, timeshare is based on what actually occurs. A court order  
 
that awards timeshare may be relevant in timeshare calculation if the order is recent and  
 
there has not been an opportunity to exercise the terms of the order. • Telephone contact with a child does not establish or increase a parent’s timeshare. • Visitation that occurs at the PRS’s residence may not establish or increase a parent’s  
 
timeshare. • If the PRS is receiving cash assistance, the maximum timeshare for the PPS is 49.99%. If  
The amount of timeshare is unknown,  
or cannot be confirmed by the PRS... The amount of timeshare is disputed,  
discuss the disputed timeshare with the  
parties and attempt to reach a  
compromise (i.e. run multiple guideline  
calculations, and inform the parents of  
the support factors) and... The amount of timeshare is confirmed  
by the PRS... Then  
Base guideline child support on a 0.00% timeshare. • If they agree use the agreed upon timeshare to

a. Draft: A draft status will not write any activity logs on the case. Draft calculations are modifiable after they are saved. Any draft calculation with no activity for 30 
days will be automatically removed from the system. Save the calculation as a "draft" if you are not finished with your work. b. Active: An Active status will write activities to the Case activities log on the case. Active calculations cannot be modified after they are saved. They will be read 
only files. Active calculations will remain on the system permanently. Save the calculation as "active" when documents are generated based on the calculation.'),

¡ A credit under "Other Child Support Paid" should be given instead in this situation and the CSS in court will run a second calculation in court to

1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. To perform the Dueling scenario, you must sign in to two (or more) sessions of CSE. Access one of the cases in question in each session. Complete the calculation in one of the cases and find out the total child support amount. Complete the calculation in the second case taking into account the amount of child support from first case in the Child Support Paid (Other  Relationship) field. Return to the first case and enter the total amount of child support from the second case in the Child Support Paid (Other Relationship) field and re- calculate the 
amount. Return to the second case, update the Child Support Paid (Other Relationship) field with the new amount from the first case, and recalculate. Continue the process until 
the total child support amount on both cases no longer changes, then save each case’s calculation. Miscellaneous Scenarios  
+ Zero Dollar Calculation   
Scenario: A Guideline Calculation must be attached to every S&C, including $0.00 S&Cs. Some other legal actions may also require a guideline calculation to be attached, even if 
the action is requesting a $0.00 order. In these situations, a $0.00 When generating a $0.00 calculation must be created to attach to the  legal actions in CSE. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
