§   3910; see   IRMO Drake (1997)53 Cal.App.4
th
 1139, 
1154 [father  had  a  duty  to  support  adult  disabled  
child   despite   income   from   trust   established   by   
mother for the adult child]). To establish that an adult 
disabled child support order is appropriate, the court 
must  find  that  the  child  is  both  unable  to  be  self- 
supporting  (incapacitated)  and  “without  sufficient  
means”  (likely  to  become  a  public  charge).
  (IRMO 
Cecilia  and  David  W.  (2015)  241  Cal.App.4
th
 
1277). 
The child’s disability must be verified to have 
occurred prior to the age of majority which may be in 
the form  of,  but  is  not  limited  to,  a    court  finding, 
disability  benefit  assessments,  medical  records,  or  
special educational  need  assessments  (CSSP  Letter 
19-07). Because   a   parent’s   duty   to   support   an   
incapacitated adult child runs to the child, it may be 
appropriate  under  certain  circumstances  for  adult  
child  support  payments  to  be  made  directly  to  the  
child. 
(IRMO Drake (2015) 241 Cal.App.4
th
 934). 
 NOTE: A  disabled  child’s  own  benefits  do  not  
relieve a parent’s duty to pay child support and shall 
not  be  used  as  income  for  either  parent  in  the  
calculation of support. 
6. Order Commencement 
An  original  child  support  order  may  only  be  made  
retroactive   to   the   date   of   filing   the   petition,   
complaint, or   other initial pleading. If the parent was 
not  served  within  90  days  after  filing  and  the  court  
finds  that  the  parent  was  not  intentionally  evading  
service, support shall be effective no earlier than the 
date   of   service.   (
FC   §   4009).   Note   that   this   
restriction is not applicable on default judgments. 
 
B. GUIDELINE CALCULATION  
1. Guideline 
California  has  implemented  a  “statewide  uniform  
guideline”  for  determining  child  support  according  
to a complex algebraic formula based on the parents’',

incomes  and  custodial  time  with  the  child.  (FC  §  
4055). 
2. Guideline  Calculator 
The   California   DCSS   website   includes   a   public   
guideline calculator. (https://dcss.ca.gov/). 
3. Principles 
The general    principles    underlying    the guideline 
formula are listed in 
FC § 4053 and include: 
a. First and Principal Obligation 
A   parent’s   first   and   principal   obligation   is   to   
support  his  or  her  minor  children  according to the 
parent’s  circumstances  and  station  in  life.  (
FC  §  
4053(a)). 
b. Mutual Responsibility 
Both   parents   are   mutually   responsible   for   the   
support of their children. (
FC § 4053(b)). 
c. Income 
The  guideline  accounts  for  each  parent’s  actual  
income  and  level  of  responsibility  for  the  children.  
(
FC § 4053(c)). 
d. Ability 
Each  parent  should  pay  for  the  support  of  the  
children  according  to  his  or  her  ability.  (
FC  §  
4053(d)). 
e. Interests of Children 
The guideline seeks to place the interests of   children 
as the state’s top priority. (
FC § 4053(e)). 
f. Standard of Living 
Children  should  share  in  the  standard  of  living  of  
both   parents.   Child   support   may   appropriately   
improve  the  standard  of  living  of  the  custodial  
household. (
FC § 4053(f)). In one appellate case, a 
father  was  ordered  to  pay  temporary  child  and  
spousal  support  of  $13,488  per  month  and  $30,000  
per month, respectively, to allow the minor children 
to  share  in  the  standard  of  living  of  both  parents.

10850  and  Evidence  Code  section  1040,  subdivision  
(b)(2).  We  shall  conclude  that  the  records  are  not  
privileged and are subject to subpoena for use in the 
claims that its welfare records relating to paternity are 
privileged  from disclosure  under  the  provisions of 
Welfare and Institutions Code section 
paternity action.” 
4. Multiple  Parents 
In any case in which a child has more than two parents, 
the statewide uniform guideline, as required by federal 
regulations,    shall    be    applied    to    determine    the    
respective    parent’s    support    obligation.    (
FC    §    
4052.5(a)
).   “The  court  shall  apply  the  guideline  by  
dividing child support obligations among the parents 
based  on  income  and  amount  of  time  spent  with  the  
child by each parent pursuant to  Section 4053.
”   (FC § 
4052.5(a)). 
5. Aid Status is Relevant 
a. The court may inquire of the parties’ aid status 
(currently   receiving   or   intends   to   apply)   for   
purposes of determining their respective sources of 
income and verifying assignment of support rights 
to  the County as an indispensable party. 
(FC § 4004) 
b. Aid amount is confidential and irrelevant since it 
is  not  considered  income,  has  no  impact  to  the  
calculation  of  guideline  support,  and  not  a  factor  
allowing  deviation  from  guideline  support.  (FC  §  
4058(c),  see County  of  Alameda  v.  Johnson

th

including     family     grant     amounts.     (Welfare     &

disclose  aid  status of  the  parties  who  can  voluntarily  
provide   the   amount   themselves   if   they   desire   to   
disclose – i.e, on the I&E. (Welfare & Institution Code, 
supra) 
6. Adult  Disabled  Child 
Although  the  statute  for  adult  disabled  child  support  
does not specify, case law provides that the statewide 
uniform child support guidelines apply to determining 
support   for   adult   disabled   child.   (
FC  §  3910(a); 
IRMO Drake (1997) 53 Cal.App.4
th
 1139). 
7. Child’s Income 
Parents  bear  the  primary  obligation  to  support  their  
child and may only use the child’s own resources if the 
parents  are  financially  unable  to  fulfill  the  obligation  
themselves. (
FC § 3902, see Armstrong v. Armstrong 
(1976)  15  Cal.3d  942  [a  child’s  independent  income  
does  not  impact  the  noncustodial  parent’s  duty  to  
support the child]). 
C. REBUTTING THE GUIDELINE AMOUNT  
1. Factors  for  Deviating 
The   amount   of   child   support   established   by   the   
guideline  calculator  is  presumed  to  be  correct.  (
FC  §  
4057(a)).  Pursuant  to  FC  §  4057(b), the  guideline  
amount  may  be  rebutted  by  showing  its  application  
would  be  unjust  or  inappropriate  in  a  particular  case  
because one or more of the following factors: 
a. Stipulation   of   the   parties   (which   requires   
declarations pursuant to 
FC § 4065(a)); 
b. 
Deferred residence sale order; 
c. 
Amount   would   exceed   the   needs   of   the   
children   because   of   the   extraordinarily   high   
income  of  the  obligor  (in  conflict  with  
FC  §  
4053(f) and see conflicting case law: S.P. v. F.G.

substantially equal timeshare and great difference 
in  income  used  for  housing,  special  medical  or  
other needs of the children, or the child has more 
than  two  parents.  (
See  IRMO  Rodriguez  (2018)23 
Cal.App.5th  625  for  a  discussion  on  the  trial  
court’s  ‘considerable’  discretion  to  consider  the  
unique  special  circumstances  presented  in  each  
case).
 
 NOTE: Even  where  one  or  more  of  the  listed  
circumstances     is     present,     deviation     from     
guideline must remain consistent with the  broad  
principles set forth in 
FC §   4053.  (FC §   4057(b)). 
2. Written  Findings 
If  the  court  orders  non-guideline  support,  it  must  
state   in   writing   or   on   the   record   the   following   
information pursuant to 
FC § 4056: 
a. The   guideline   amount   of   support   (IRMO 
Hubner

 175, 184); 
b. 
The  reasons  the  amount  ordered  differs  from  
guideline; and,
 
c. 
The  reasons  the  amount  ordered  is  in  the  best  
interests of the children
 
 NOTE: The  required  findings  must  be  made  
sua  sponte  and  are  not  dependent  on  a  specific 
request  by  either  party.  (

th
  313).  Court’s  failure  to  state  on  
the record reasons for deviation caused reversal 
of order. (see 
Y.R. v. A.F., supra). 
3. Burden of Proof 
The party seeking deviation from guideline support 
bears the burden of proving the formula is unjust or 
inappropriate.  (

4. Special  Circumstances 
FC   §   4057   does   not   specify   all   the   special   
circumstances in which the guideline amount would 
be  inappropriate;  courts  have  broad  discretion  to  
determine when such circumstances apply. (

per    month,    was    appropriate    in    the    unique    
circumstances of the case]). 
5. Guideline    Exceeds    Public    Assistance    Grant 
The fact that the monthly public assistance payment 
is  less  than  the  guideline  amount  is  not  a    special 
circumstance   warranting   deviation.   (
County of 
Alameda v. Johnson (1994) 28 Cal.App.4
th
 259, 263- 
264). 
6. Relocation 
A  custodial  parent’s  relocation  to  another  state  and  
resultant   increase   in   visitation   expenses   for   the   
noncustodial parent might justify a reduction in the 
guideline amount. (Compare 
Wilson v. Shea (2001) 
87 Cal.App.4
th
  887 with IRMO Gigliotti (1995) 33 
Cal.App.4
th 
518). 
7. Discretion  Limited 
“[I]n  reviewing  child  support  orders  we  must  also  
recognize   that   determination   of   a   child   support   
obligation is a highly regulated area of the law, and 
the  only  discretion  a  trial  court  possesses  is  the  
discretion  provided  by  statute  or  rule.”  (
IRMO

 462, 465). 
1. LCSA  Signature  Necessary 
“A  stipulated  agreement  for  child  support  is  not  
valid unless the [LCSA] has joined in the stipulation 
by  signing  it  in  any  case  in  which  the  [LCSA]  is

2. Welfare  Stipulations 
“The [LCSA] shall not stipulate to below guideline 
child support if the children are receiving assistance 
under the CalWORKs program, if an application for 
public assistance   is   pending,   or   if   the   parent   
receiving  support  has  not  consented  to  the  order.”  
(
FC § 4065(c)). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  In  2013,  California  Department 
of  Social  Services  implemented  aid  codes  K1  and  3F,  
state-only  funded  programs,  which  are  not  referable  to 
or  recoupable  by  the  child  support  program  Although 
any    arrears    accrued    under    K1    or    3F    are    not 
permanently  assigned,  they  cannot  be  waived  as  they  
accumulated   when   the   family   unit   was   on   public   
assistance. (CSS Letter 15-09). 
3. Non-Welfare  Stipulations 
If  non-welfare  parties  wish  to  stipulate  to  a  below- 
guideline  amount,  make  sure  that  a  FC  §  4065(a)  
waiver is executed or   put on the record. The elements 
are: 
a. The  parties  are  fully  informed  of  their  rights  
concerning child support. 
b. The order is being agreed to without coercion or 
duress. 
c. The  agreement  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  
children involved. 
d. The  needs  of  the  children  will  be  adequately  
met by the stipulated amount. 
e. The  right  to  support  has  not  been  assigned  to

 PRACTICE     POINT:     Because     there     is     no     
assignment  of  rights  for  K1  and  3F  custodial  parents, 
the  signature  of  the  party  receiving  aid  is  necessary  for  
any  stipulation  to  guideline  child  support.  If  a  K1  or  3F  
custodial  parent  wants  to  stipulate  to  below-guideline 
child   support,   the   case   must   go   to   court   for   a   
determination that   the agreement   is   in   the best 
interests  of  the  children  and  the  needs  of  the  children 
will  be  adequately  met  by  the  stipulated  amount.  (CSS  
Letter 15-09). 
 
4. Change of Circumstances 
No  change  of  circumstances  need  be  shown  for  
modification  of  a  below-guideline  stipulated  order.  
(
FC   §   4065(d)).   However,   an   above-guideline 
stipulated   order   cannot   be   modified   downward   
unless  the  obligor  presents  admissible  evidence  of  
changed        financial        circumstances.        (

E. INCOME AND SOURCES OF INCOME  
1. Definition  of  Income  Generally 
Income   is   broadly   defined   for   the   purpose   of   
calculating guideline child support under 
FC § 4058. 
It   includes, but is not limited to, commissions, salaries, 
royalties, wages, bonuses, rents, dividends, pensions, 
interest,      trust      income,      annuities,      workers’      
compensation    benefits,    unemployment    insurance    
benefits,  disability  insurance  benefits,  social  security  
benefits, spousal support, income from proprietorship 
of    a    business,    employee    benefits,    and    self- 
employment benefits. 
Income  is  further  defined  as  the  gain  or  recurrent  
benefit  derived  from  labor,  business,  property,  or  
from   any   other   investment   of   capital.   (

presumption  does  not  apply  to  tax  returns  of  a  self-
employed  parent  who  controls  the  reporting  of  income  
and    business    expenses.    (IRMO    Hein (2020)    52

2. Not Income 
Income  from  child  support  payments  and  income

purposes. (

3. Fluctuating  Income 
If  a  party  has  fluctuating  income,  income  must  be  
calculated using a representative time period, which 
usually  means  at  least  a  12-month  average.  (

4064

Cal.App.4
th
   1075 [court   abused   its   discretion   by   
using only two months of income]). 
4. Overtime 
A  court  should  use  an  obligor’s  past  overtime  and  
bonus   pay   in   calculating   annual   income   unless   
evidence suggests it is not likely to recur. (
County of 
Placer v. Andrade (1997) 55 Cal.App.4

 225, the court held 
that  an  obligor  who  had  worked  excessive  hours  
during  the  marriage  was  not  obligated  to  continue  
extraordinary overtime after separation. 
5. Bonus  Income 
Bonus  income  is  considered  income  for  purposes  of  
calculating support. (
FC § 4058). However, when no 
future  bonus  income  is  guaranteed,  support  should  
be determined using base salary income and bonuses 
should  only  be  considered  when  actually  received.  
(
IRMO  Scheppers,  supra, 86 Cal.App.4
th
  646). 
Alternatively, a portion of future bonuses should be 
allocated  by  way  of  a  percentage.  (

6. Deferred  Income 
a. An obligor’s practice of “deferring” his salary 
in order to protect his investment in his business 
warranted   including   that   salary   as   current   
income for purposes of 
FC §  4058(a) or, in the 
alternative,  as  a  “special  circumstance”  under  
FC § 4057(b)(5) that would justify treating the 
deferral salary as current income for purposes of 
child  support.  (See

7. Employment Benefits 
If   a   benefit   is   received   from   an   employer   as   
compensation for services, it is “income” and should 
be  included  in  the  guideline.  (

for  deviation  from  guideline  under

“Expenditures  required  for  the  operation  of  the

business    expenses    directly    related    to    or    
associated  with  the  active,  day-to-day  conduct  
of the business; (

th
 1407, 1425). 
b. Business Expenses and Deductions 
The depreciation  of  a  business  asset  should  
not    be    subtracted    because    it    is    neither 
required  for  the  operation  of  the  business  nor 
is    it    an    actual    expenditure.    (
Asfaw    v.    
Woldberham, supra
, at 1423.) 
The reasoning  in  Asfaw  has  been  extended  to  
claimed  depreciation  for  motor  vehicles  used  as  
business  assets.  (
IRMO  Rodriguez,  supra,  23 
Cal.App.5
th
 625.)   
Similarly, Section 179 elections to expense assets 
up   front   (as   opposed   to   depreciating   them   
overtime)   should   be   added   back   in   when   
calculating   income   used   for   support.   (IRMO 
Hein (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 519, 533 (certified for 
partial publication)). 
On  the  other  hand,  one  court  held  that  funds  
spent diversifying   a   company   are   reasonable   
expenses  properly  chargeable  to  the  business  
and should not be included in the calculation of 
income  for  spousal  support  purposes.  (IRMO

9. Social Security  Retirement or Disability  (Title 
II Benefits) 
  Social  Security  benefits  may  be  paid  as  disability,  
retirement,    survivor,    or    needs-based    benefits.    
Disability,   retirement   and   survivor   benefits   are   
based on past earnings history and, therefore, can be 
considered  as  income  in  setting  support  and  are  
subject  to  collection  for  child  support  through  wage  
assignment. (
FC § 4058(a)(1) and FC § 5206). 
a. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) 
SSDI  is  paid  to  individuals  who  have  a  medical  
condition   that   meets   the   SSA’s   definition   of   
disability  and  have  worked  in  jobs  where  they  
paid   into   social   security.      Upon   reaching   full   
retirement  age,  the  SSDI  benefits  automatically  
convert  to  retirement  benefits,  but  the  amount  
generally remains the same. 
i. SSDI  is  generally  nontaxable  but  may  be  
taxable  if  the  benefit  amount  in  addition  to  
other income exceeds a certain amount. 
 
ii. A  mandatory  motion  to  modify  support  is  
required    within    30    days    of    receipt    of 
verification   from   the   obligor   or   any   other   
source that the obligor is receiving SSDI. (

in a job that contributed to social security taxes for 
10   or   more   years,   becomes   eligible   for   social

A  recipient  may  still  become  eligible  for  survivor  
benefits   if   he/she/they   have   not   contributed   to   
social   security   based   upon   a   current   or   prior   
spouse’s work history.  
Retirement   benefits   are   generally   taxable   and   
subject to enforcement of support payments. 
c. Derivative Benefits 
With  SSA benefits,  children  and  step-children  of  a  
recipient  may  be  eligible  for  direct  benefits  based  
on  the  supporting  person’s  award.  
FC  §  4504(a) 
requires the custodial parent or   obligee to apply for 
derivative   benefits   after   notification   of   possible   
eligibility. 
i. Credit Against Support Obligation 
a) Any  derivative  benefits  received  by  the  
obligee   because   of   the   obligor’s   benefits   
must    be    credited    toward    the    support    
obligation.  (

FC§  4504(b),  holding  
that derivative benefits paid to the custodial 
parent  on  behalf  of  the  minor  children  of  a  
disabled  obligor  are  not considered income 
for  purposes  of  determining  the  support  
order.  Instead,  those  payments  are  to  be 
credited against the obligor’s support order. 
Therefore,   no   credit   is   applied   if   the   
derivative  benefits  were  considered  by  the  
court  in  determining  the  amount  of  child  
support to be paid, because they are already 
credited  in  the  order,  offsetting  the  current  
support amount. (
FC § 4504(b)).

PRACTICE  POINT:  Derivative  benefits  are  NOT  the  
same   as   funds   received   based   upon   the   child’s

overpayment    can    occur    if    the    LCSA    
continues   to   collect   from   other   income   
sources.  There  will  be  no  overpayment  if  
credits are solely from derivative benefits. 
ii. Custodial Parent Noncompliance 
If  a  custodial  parent  refuses  to  apply  for  
derivative  benefits  or  fails  to  cooperate  to  
complete  the  application  of    payments,  but 
the  child  is  otherwise  eligible  to  receive  the  
benefits,  the  noncustodial  parent  shall  be  
credited with  the amount  that   the   child 
would have received for that month had the 
custodial parent  completed  the  application.  
The    noncustodial   parent   must   provide 
evidence to the LCSA indicating the amount 
the   child   would   have   received.   (
FC   §   
4504(c)). 
iii. Lump-Sum Retroactive Payments 
a) A  custodial  parent  will  often  receive  a  
lump     sum     retroactive     payment     for     
derivative   benefits.   It   is   usually   for   the   
interim  period  between  when  the  obligor  
begins receiving his own benefits and when 
the    custodial    parent    begins    receiving 
derivative benefits for the minor  child(ren). 
The lump sum payment will be paid directly 
to the custodial parent even if the child was 
aided during the months that the lump sum 
payment  covers.  The  obligor  gets  credit  for  
the    lump    sum    payment    towards    the',

received    as    a    lump-sum    was    recently

California, 
Y.H.    v.    M.H. (2018)    25    
Cal.App.5th   300.   In   
Y.H .,   the   Court   of   
Appeal affirmed the trial court’s ruling that 
FC   §   4054(b)   permits   retroactive   child   
support  credit  from  a  lump-sum  derivative  
benefit  payment,  even  where  there  is  no  
arrearage  owed.  According  to  the  Court  in 
Y.H ., the proper application of payments is 
to first credit the derivative  benefit  for  each  
month     represented     in     the     lump-sum 
benefits   paid,   and   then   credit   any   child   
support   payments   made   by   the   obligor   
from  other  sources  in  each  corresponding 
month.   This  will  properly  determine  the  
arrears   balance,   if   any,   or   any   resulting   
overpayment.    The   additional   source   of   
payment  (not  the  derivatives)  may  be  the 
possible  source  of   overpayment.   From   a   
public  policy  standpoint,  the  Court  in  
Y.H. 
recognized  that  “the  aim  of    the legislature 
[in   enacting 
CCP   §   695.221   regarding 
payment   distribution   hierarchy]   was   to   
broaden  how  a  lump-sum  payment  could  
be credited  to  a  noncustodial  parent’s  child  
support obligation, not narrow it.”

not provided to support appellant alone.”] They  are  
issued   based   upon   retirement,   service-connected 
disability, non-service-connected disability, financial 
need,  or  any  combination  of  these.  The  primary  
factors in determining whether veteran’s benefits are 
income  are  whether  1)  paid  as  remuneration  for  
employment and 2) whether the veteran has waived 
any portion of retirement pay in order to receive VA 
benefits.  The  LCSA  must  contact  the  regional  VA  
office  to  determine  the  waiver  of  retirement  pay.  
(See, DCSS PI Letter 02-61 (09/26/2002). 
a. Non-Service-Connected Permanent  Disability 
i. Also known as “veteran’s pension,” it is not 
incurred  in  the  line  of  duty.  This  is  a  distinct  
benefit  issued  to  a  veteran  of  a  war  who  is  
totally   and   permanently   disabled   and   is   
considered  “needs-based.”  Veteran’s  pension  
does  not  qualify  as  income  and  is  exempt  
from   enforcement,   qualifying   the   case   for   
closing  if  the  servicemember  has  no  other  
income or assets. 
b. Military Retired Pay 
i. Retired pay is paid for retirement from active 
service    and    is    generally    taxable    income    
available   for   support.   It   is   also   subject   to   
garnishment.  An  exception  applies  when  the  
veteran  is  eligible  for  disability  compensation  
and   waives   a   portion   of   retirement   pay   in   
exchange  for  service-connected  disability  pay  
(see above). 
c. Service-connected Permanent Disability 
i. Incurred    in    the    line    of    duty,    service-
connected disability is compensation for future 
lost  wages  or  opportunities  due  to  a  disability  
incurred or aggravated during military service.

Rental  income   to   the   oblige   from   any   source   is   
income  for  support.  
FC  §4058(a).  from  a  sublease  
of  a  room  may  be  included  as  additional  income  to  
calculate  support.  (See  also,  County  of  Orange  v.  
Smith   (2005), 132 Cal.App.4
th
   1434,   where   the   
additional   rent   from   a   sublease   of   a   room   was   
appropriately  included  in  calculating  support.)  The  
court  may  consider  deductions  for  rental-  related 
expenses   (see   IRS   Form   1040,   Schedule   E)   as   it   
deems appropriate. 
13. New  Spouse  Income 
New  spouse  income  can  be  considered  only  as  an  
additional source of support in cases where it can be 
shown  to  be  an  “extraordinary  case,”  leading  to  
“extreme  and  severe  hardship”  to  any  child  if  the 
income  is  not  considered.  (
FC  §  4057.5(a); IRMO 
Knowles (2009)     178     Cal.App.4
th
 35).     An     
extraordinary   case   may   include   a   parent   who   
voluntarily  or  intentionally  quits  work  or  reduces  
income, or who intentionally remains unemployed or 
underemployed and relies on a subsequent spouse’s 
income. (
FC § 4057.5(b)). Discovery of   the spouse’s 
income  shall  be  based  on  W2  and  1099  income  tax  
forms. (
FC § 4057.5(c)) 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  If  a  parent  files  taxes  jointly,  a  
new   spouse’s   income   should   be   included   in   the   
calculation   to   accurately   estimate   the   parent’s   tax   
obligations.   (FC   §   4059(a); County   of   Tulare   v.   
Campbell (1996) 50 Cal.App.4
th
 847, 854). 
 
14. Monetary  Gifts 
Monetary gifts   can   be   considered   income   for   
purposes of child support when the gift is paid on a 
regular  and  periodic  basis.  IRMO  Alter  (2009)  171',

15. Personal  Injury  Settlements 
Undifferentiated  lump  sum  personal  injury  awards  
and    undifferentiated    personal    injury    annuity    
settlement  awards  are  not  considered  income  for  
determining  child  support.  It  is  the  burden  of  the  
parent    seeking    inclusion    to    prove    that    some    
component  of  the  payment  was  compensation  for  
lost wages.        (
IRMO    Rothrock (2008) 159 
Cal.App.4

award  specifically  allocated  for  lost  income  may  be

parent   is   capable   of   attending   school,   consider   
whether  it  would  be appropriate  to  impute  income  
(below). An obligor who wishes to pursue a   different 
lifestyle or endeavor must consider child support as 
a financial obligation which must be paid first before 
any    other    expenses.    (
IRMO    Ilas    (1993)    12    
Cal.App.4

 1630). 
19. Life  Insurance  Benefits 
Life  insurance  benefits  received  by  a  parent  are  not  
income   for   support   purposes.   (IRMO   Scheppers   
(2001)  86  Cal.App.4
th
  646).  But,  effective  January  
2020,  life  insurance  proceeds  are  subject  to  child  
support   intercepts   (liens).   So,   NCPs   who   are   
beneficiaries to life insurance claims will be subjected 
to a  lien, absent the exceptions stated in the Insurance 
Code. “An   insurer   shall   identify   and   report   a   
claimant   to   the   Department   of   Child   Support   
Services  if  the  claim  seeks  an  economic  benefit  for  
an obligor who owes past-due child support. (1) An 
“economic  benefit”  under  a  life  insurance  policy,  
disability   income   insurance   policy,   or   annuity   
means  a  payment  totaling  at  least  one  thousand  
dollars ($1,000) ...” (Insurance Code Article 8 Section 
13550). 
20. Inheritances 
An   inheritance   is   not   income   for   child   support

employment  and  live  off  the  inheritance  proceeds,  
consider  arguing  income  should  be  imputed  (see 
below). 
21. Trusts and  Trust  Income 
A  beneficiary’s  income  from  a  trust  is  considered  
income    for    child    support    purposes.    (
FC    §    
4058(a)(1)

“shutdown” clause in the trust]). 
22. Capital  Assets 
a. Generally 
Capital  assets  are  not  income  for  child  support  
purposes.  Income  from  capital  assets,  whether  
realized  or  based  on  an  assigned  reasonable  
rate   of   return,   can   be   income   for   support

23. Non-Taxable Income 
Many  individuals,  especially  self-employed,  do  not  
pay federal or state income taxes. In those cases, it is 
inappropriate    to    account    for    tax    liability    in    
determining  the  person’s  net  disposable  income. 
Therefore,  if  the  obligor  does  not  file  taxes,  the  
income should be non-taxable. Once the parent pays 
that   tax,   he/she   can   move   to   modify   support.   
(
IRMO McQuoid (1991)9 Cal.App.4
th
 1353). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Many  obligors  artificially  inflate  
the   expense   section   of   their   Income   and   Expense 
Declarations   to   look   poor.   Use   the   amount   of   the   
exaggerated  expenses  to  show  how  much  money  they  
have  each  month  for  their  household  needs.  This  can 
be  used  as  evidence  of  the  amount  of  non-taxable 
income the person may have available each month. 
F.  EARNING CAPACITY/IMPUTING INCOME  
1. General 
The court may, in its discretion, consider the earning 
capacity  of  a  parent  in  lieu  of  the  parent’s  actual  
income,
 consistent with   the best interest of the 
children.  (
FC  §  4058(b)).  To  determine  earning  
capacity,  the  court  must  consider  a  parent’s  ability  
and opportunity to earn. (

Cal.App.4

 1070; IRMO McHugh (2014) 231

capable  of  earning  based  upon  the  person’s  “age,  
health,   education,   marketable   skills,   employment

including the party’s resume, want ads matching the 
party’s  credentials,  opinion  testimony  that  someone  
with     the     party’s     credentials     could     secure     
employment,  and  pay  scales  for  the  positions  for  
which  the  party  qualifies.  Newspaper  want  ads  are  
admissible   as   non-hearsay   evidence   of   offers   of   
employment. (

3. Bad  Faith  Showing  Unnecessary 
A  showing  that  the  obligor  acted  in  bad  faith  in 
reducing  income is  no  longer  necessary.  (

  396,  424).  “Once  persons  become  parents,  
their   desires   for   self-realization,   self-fulfillment, 
personal  job  satisfaction,  and  other  commendable 
goals  must  be  considered  in the context  of  their  
responsibilities    to    provide    for    their    children''s 
reasonable  needs. If they decide they  wish  to  lead  a  
simpler  life,  change  professions,  or  start  a  business, 
they  may  do  so,  but  only  when  they  satisfy  their  
primary  responsibility:  providing  for  the  adequate  
and  reasonable  needs  of  their  children.”  (

4. Misconduct  Resulting  in  Termination 
If   the   party   is   unemployed   due   to   their   own   
misconduct,  the  court  must  still  find  ability  and  
opportunity   to   work   before   imputing   income.

IRMO McHugh (2014) 231 Cal.App.4
th
 1238). 
5. Credibility 
When  the  credibility  of  one  parent  is  questionable,  
the  court  may  resort  to  imputing  income  because  it  
finds    financial    statements    are    misleading    and    
unreliable.  (
IRMO  Barth (2012)  210  Cal.App.4
th
 
363, 376-377). 
6. Imputing    Income    to     the    Custodial   Parent   
Courts  will  impute  income  to  custodial  parents.  In 
IRMO  LaBass  and  Munsee (1997)  56  Cal.App.4
th
 
1331, the court imputed full-time teacher earnings to 
a custodial  parent  with  teaching  credentials  who 
chose  to  be  a student  and  part-time  worker.  In 
IRMO Paulin (1996)46 Cal.App.4
th
 1378, the court 
imputed  ability  to  earn  according  to  the  custodial  
parent’s    last    earnings    when    she    voluntarily    
terminated her position. 
 NOTE:  If  the  trial  court  imputes  income  to  a  
custodial  parent,  the  imputation  must  be  supported  
by substantial evidence that the imputation is in the 
children''s     interest.     (IRMO     Ficke (2013) 217 
Cal.App.4
th
 10). 
7. Imputing     Income     to     Noncustodial     Parent     
Caretaker of Other Children 
In 
IRMO  Hinman  (1997)  55  Cal.App.4
th
  988,  the  
court imputed income to a  non-custodial parent who 
declined  to  work  in  order  to  care  for  her  young  
children from her new family. 
8. Imputing      Income      to      Public      Assistance 
Recipients 
Courts are split as to whether income can be imputed 
to  an  obligor  who  receives  public  assistance  for  
another child. (

caretaker of another child]). 
9. Welfare-to-Work  Participant 
Imputation  of  income  to  a  parent  on  CalWORKs  
would  be  contrary  to  public  policy.  (
Mendoza  v.  
Ramos (2010)  182  Cal.App.4
th
  680).  Furthermore,  a  
parent in compliance with his or her welfare-to-work 
plan  cannot  be  ordered  to  seek  work.  (
Barron  v.  
Superior Court (2009) 173 Cal.App.4
th
 293.) 
10. Reasonable  Work  Regimen 
Earning capacity generally should not be based upon 
an extraordinary work regimen, but instead upon an 
objectively    reasonable    work    regimen;    excessive    
hours    or    continuous,    substantial    overtime    are    
generally  extraordinary.  (
IRMO  Simpson  (1992)4 
Cal.4
th
  225 [obligor  was  not  required  to  continue  to  
work two or   three jobs each day, sometimes 16 hours 
per day; the court held that obligor’s earning capacity 
should  be  based  on  an  objectively  reasonable  work  
regimen]).  In IRMO  Lim and  Carrasco (2013), 
214 Cal.App.4
th
  768, a trial  court  support  award 
based   on   a   law   firm   partner   attorney’s   actual   
reduced  income  because  she  chose  an  80%  work 
schedule (rather than  imputing  full-time  income) 
was affirmed;  the mother  still  worked many  hours, 
the schedule  allowed  her  to  spend  more  time  with  
the children, and her income remained high. 
11. Incarceration 
People in prison usually have a limited opportunity 
to work, and income cannot be imputed unless there 
is the opportunity to work. (

Cal.App.4

 74; State of Oregon v. Vargas (1999) 70

a   statutory   basis   to   garnish   income   earned   by   
inmates, upon such terms as may be determined by

incarcerated  obligor  committed  a  crime  against  a  
family member. (
IRMO Smith (2001) 90 Cal.App.4
th 
74). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  At  least  one  court   has   found 
that  it  was  proper  to  impute  interest  income  on  assets  
available  to  an  incarcerated  individual  that  could  have  
been  reasonably  earned  but  was  not  actually  earned.  
(Brothers v. Kern (2007)  154 Cal.App.4

  126). 
G.  TAX STATUS  
1. Filing  Status 
When  determining  support,  state  and  federal  taxes  
credited  in  the  Guideline  shall  be  those  actually  
payable (not necessarily current withholding). (FC § 
4059(a)).  The  court  must  calculate  child  support  
based  on  actual  tax  status,  not  what  might  be  more  
advantageous for the parties. (
IRMO Carlton and 
D’Allessandro (2001)     91     Cal.App.4

 1213). 
[Obligor  did  not  have  married  filing  jointly  status  
available  to  him  because  both  parties  must  consent  
to such filing]). However, if a party has a true choice 
of  tax  status  or  tax  treatment  of  an  asset,  the  court  
should calculate support based on the best option.

To   properly   determine   taxable   income,   the   tax   
settings on the guideline calculation may need to be 
adjusted if the parent files taxes in a state other than 
California.  Taxes  are  most  often  filed  in  the  state  
which   the   parent   resides.   In   certain   situations,   
particularly  with  military  members,  the  parent  files  
taxes   in   his/her   state   of   domicile   (rather   than   
residence).    (

 PRACTICE  POINT:  Alaska,  Florida,  Nevada,  South  
Dakota,   Texas,   Washington  and Wyoming  have no 
state  income  tax.  In  New  Hampshire  and  Tennessee,  
taxes  are  imposed  on  dividends  and  interest  income  
only. 
3. Dependency  Exemptions 
Exemptions    for    dependent    children    may    be    
transferred to the other parent by written agreement. 
IRS  Form  8332  must  be  executed  and  filed  with  the  
return  for  each  year  the  exemption  is  transferred.  
(
Thomas v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
(2010) 99 T.C.M. (CCH) 1051). The trial court has the 
authority    to    allocate    dependency    exemptions    
between the parties and to order the parties execute 
and  deliver  the  documents  necessary  to  transfer  the  
exemption to the other party. (
Rios v. Pulido (2002) 
100 Cal.App.4
th
 359). 
4. New Spouse  Income  for Tax Purposes 
Be  sure  to  check  each  party’s  filing  status  and  new  
spouse income. Adding the spouse’s income (for tax 
purposes only) creates a    more accurate picture of   the 
supporting   parent’s   true   tax   liability   and   is   not   
contrary  to  
FC  §  4057.5.  (County  of  Tulare  v.  
Campbell 
(1996) 50 Cal.App.4
th
 847).  
H.  OTHER GUIDELINE FACTORS  
1. Timeshare 
The guideline calculation considers the approximate 
percentage of time each party has “primary physical 
responsibility”      for      the      children.      (
FC      §      
4055(a)(1)(D)). If  a parent wants credit for time that 
the child is not physically with the parent, the parent 
has  the burden  of    producing  admissible  evidence 
demonstrating he or she is primarily responsible for 
that  child during  those  challenged  times.  (DaSilva 
v.  DaSilva  (2004)  119  Cal.App.4
th
  1030 [factors

court  should  not  only  consider  which  parent  bears  
the financial burden, but the “practical reality of   day- 
to-day responsibility for a child.” (

wherein the trial court’s attribution of timeshare not 
actually   exercised   by   Father   in   the   guideline 
calculation was reversible error. 
2. Deductions 
To  determine  the  net  disposable  income  of  each  
parent, the following amounts are deducted from the 
gross income (
FC § 4059): 
a. State  and  federal  income  tax  liability,  FICA,  
and state disability insurance premiums; 
b. Mandatory    union    dues    and    retirement    
benefits; 
c. Health insurance or health plan premiums for 
the parent and for any children the parent has 
an obligation to support; 
d. Any child or   spousal support actually paid (for 
other children and spouses); 
e. Necessary  job-related  expenses,  if  allowed  by  
the court; 
f. Hardships (explained below). 
3. Hardships 
The court may allow income deductions if a   parent is 
experiencing   “extreme   financial   hardship   due   to   
justifiable expenses” because of: 
a. Extraordinary  health  expenses  for  which  the  
parent    is    financially    responsible    (
FC   §   
4071(a)(1)
);

c. The  minimum  basic  living  expenses  of  the  
parent’s  natural  or  adopted  children  whom  
the  parent  has  an  obligation  to  support  who  
reside with the parent. (
FC § 4071(a)(2)). 
1)The maximum hardship for other children 
may  be  equal  to,  but  shall  not  exceed,  the  
support  allocated  each  child  subject  to  the  
order. (FC § 4071(b)).  
 Note  that  a  parent  cannot  obtain  a  
hardship  for  step-children,  parents,  or  
siblings. (

Gill 
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4
th
 462). 
4. Written  Findings  for  Hardships 
If  the  court  grants  a  hardship  deduction,  the  court  
must: 
a. State the reasons for the hardship in writing or 
on the record; 
b. Document  the  amount  of  the  deduction  and  
the underlying facts and circumstances; and 
c. If    possible,    specify    the    duration    of    the    
deduction.  (
FC  §  4072).  Failure  to  make  the  
requisite  hardship  findings  pursuant  to  
FC  §  
4072 is reversible error unless evidence exists 
in  the  record  from  which  findings  can  be  
implied.      (
IRMO  Carlsen (1996)   50 
Cal.App.4
th
 212). 
5. Low-Income  Adjustment 
FC §   4055(b)(7) provides a   rebuttable presumption 
that   the   low-income   adjustment   applies   if   the   
obligor’s net disposable monthly income is less than 
$1,500.  This  amount  is  adjusted  annually  by  the  
Judicial   Council   for   cost-of  -living   increases.   (See 
http://www.courts.ca.gov/8933.htm    for    FAQs    on

applies   if   the   obligor’s   net   disposable   monthly   
income is less than $2,137.00. In these cases, the court 
shall  presume  the  obligor  is  entitled  to  the  low- 
income  adjustment  unless  it  would  be  unjust  and  
inappropriate in the particular case. 
6. Additional  Child  Support 
The  amounts  below  shall  be  considered  additional  
support for the children and shall be divided one-half 
to   each   parent,   unless   proration   based   on   each   
parent’s net disposable income is appropriate. (
FC § 
4061). 
a. Mandatory Additional Child Support 
1) Childcare costs related to employment or   to 
reasonably necessary education or   training for 
employment skills. (
FC § 4062(a)(1)). 
2) Reasonable uninsured health care costs for 
the minor children. (FC § 4062(a)(2)). 
b. Discretionary Additional Child Support 
1) Cost related to educational or   special needs 
of  the  children.  (
FC  §  4062(b)(1); IRMO 
Schlafly (2007) 149 Cal.App.4

A threshold issue in any request for modification of 
child support is whether there is a   showing of   change 
of  circumstances.  (

if  the  case  has  an  above-guideline  stipulated  order,

105 
 
 
PRACTICE   POINT:  You  may  want  to  request  a  
Statement  of  Decision  pursuant  to  FC  §  3654  when 
responding  to  this  type  of  motion  to  make  a  record  for 
de  novo  hearings  or  to  appeal  the  court’s  ruling.  If  you 
request  it,  the  court  must  issue  a  statement.  (IRMO 
Sellers (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1007; IRMO 
Shimkus (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1262. See also CCP § 
632 regarding restrictions and timeframes). 
V. RELIEF  FROM  JUDGMENT  
A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS RE: SERVICE  
1. Quash  Service 
Defendant can move to quash an improperly served 
summons  only  on  or  before  the  last  day  to  plead.  
(CCP   §   418.10(a))   Filing   a   motion   under   this   
provision  does  not  constitute  a  general  appearance.  
(CCP § 418.10(d)). 
2. Presumption 
“The   return   of   a   process   server...establishes   a   
presumption,   affecting   the   burden   of   producing   
evidence, of   the facts stated in the return.” (EC §    647) 
This   means   the   defendant   must   prove   defective   
service first, subject to cross-examination, before the 
process  server  testifies.  (But  see  below  regarding  
false proofs of service.) 
3. General  Appearance 
A  general  appearance  by  a  party  is  equivalent  to  
personal service of summons on such party. (
CCP § 
410.50(a))  A  defendant  appears  in  an  action  when 
the defendant answers. (
CCP § 1014) 
A general appearance made after entry of judgment 
has  the  effect  of  curing  any  defect  arising  from  the  
lack of   jurisdiction due to the failure to serve or notify 
a   person of   the proceedings. (Adoption of Matthew 
B. (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1239) 
4. “Doe”  as Person  Served 
A  proof  of  service  is  not  facially  invalid  simply  
because it lists “John Doe, co-resident” as the person 
served.  (Trackman v. Kenney (2010)  187 Cal.App.4

175)',

106 
 
 
5. Time for Service 
The summons and complaint must be served within 
3 years after the complaint is filed, or the action will 
be dismissed. (
CCP § 583.210 and CCP § 583.250) 
Time is tolled, however, when the validity of service 
is the subject of litigation. (
CCP § 583.240(c)) 
6. False Proof  of Service 
A court has the inherent power to set aside a default 
judgment  obtained  based  on  a  fraudulent  proof  of  
service  where  the  judgment  is  void  for  violating  
fundamental  due  process.  (County  of  San  Diego  v.  
Gorham (2010) 186 Cal.App.4
th
 1215 [defendant was 
incarcerated when “personally served” at home]; but 
see Yolo    County    DCSS    v.    Myers (2016)    248    
Cal.App.4
th
  42 [defendant’s  self-serving  statement  
that he had not lived at the address where substitute 
service was effectuated was insufficient to rebut the 
presumption  of  valid  service]).  Actual  notice  of  the  
action is not a substitute for proper service and does 
not confer jurisdiction. (American Express Centurion 
Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4
th
 383 [the proof of 
service described defendant as Asian with black hair, 
while   defendant   was   in   fact   not   Asian   with   
brown/grey hair]; but see 
FC § 3691, infra in Part J. 
Equitable Relief). 
 NOTE:  Zara involved a   motion to quash based on 
fraudulent service in non-support litigation and does 
not implicate the provisions of 
FC § 3691 regarding 
set aside (see below). 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   If   the   defendant   raises   a   
challenge   to   service   (e.g.   alleging   no   service   or 
substitute  service  was  improper),  consider  re-serving 
the  defendant  if  he/she  visits  the  LCSA  or  appears  in  
court.

a  party  from  a  support  order,  or  any  part  or  parts  
thereof, after the six-month time limit of Section 473

F.    DISESTABLISHMENT OF PATERNITY – FC § 7645 
et seq. 
relieving  a  party  from  a  support  order  based  upon  
lack of notice. (
FC § 3691(c)(3)). 
A support order may not be set aside simply because 
a court finds that it was inequitable when made, nor 
because  subsequent  circumstances  have  caused  the  
support  amount  ordered  to  become  excessive  or  
inadequate. (
FC § 3692). 
If  a  court  determines  that  the  relief  is  appropriate,  
then  it  shall  only  set  aside  the  provisions  materially  
affected by the circumstances leading to the decision 
to grant relief. However, a   court has discretion to set 
aside  the  entire  order  for  equitable  considerations.  
(
FC § 3693). 
See Section III.M – Parentage. 
G. PRESUMED INCOME DEFAULT –   FC §   17432  
1. Presumed  Income  Set  Aside 
If  a  judgment  or  order  for  support  was  based  upon  
presumed income as specified in 
FC § 17400(d) and 
the   obligor’s   income   was   substantially   different   
during  the  period  of  time  the  order  was  effective  
compared  to  the  obligor’s  presumed  income,  the  
court   may   set   aside   the   support   portion   of   the   
judgment   and   recalculate   support   according   to   
current  guidelines  with  the  same  commencement  
date  as  set  forth  in  the  default  judgment.  (
FC  §  
17432(c) and FC § 17432(i)). 
2. Substantial  Difference 
Substantial  difference  is  defined  as  the  amount  of  
income that would result in an order for support that 
deviates from the order entered by 10% or   more. (
FC 
§  17432(c))  The  obligor  must  file  an  Income  and  
Expense Declaration or other income information for 
relevant years. (
FC § 17432(d)). 
3. Deadline 
A motion for relief must be filed within 1 year of the 
first collection. (

4. Duty of the LCSA 
If an order was established using presumed income, 
the LCSA is required, within 3 months of the date of 
the   first   collection,   to   check   appropriate   income   
sources  and  determine  whether  the  order  qualifies  
for  set  aside.  If  the  LCSA  determines  the  order  
qualifies for set aside, it must file a motion for relief.

(2010)  186  Cal.App.4
th
  1215,  1232  [reiterating  that  
this is a mandatory duty]). 
5. Court  Considerations 
Before   granting   relief,   the   court   is   required   to   
consider  the  amount  of  time  that  has  passed  since  
entry of   the order, the circumstances surrounding the 
defendant’s  default,  the  relative  hardship  on  the  
child(ren),  the  caretaker  parent,  and  the  defendant,  
and other equitable factors. (
FC § 17432(h)). 
H. MISTAKEN IDENTITY – FC § 17433  
1. Judicial  Relief 
If  a  defendant  can  establish  that  he  or  she  was  
mistakenly identified in a default judgment or order 
as   the   person   having   an   obligation   to   provide   
support, the court is required to relieve the defendant 
from the judgment or order. (
FC § 17433) 
2. Administrative  Review 
A  person  alleging  mistaken  identity  can  seek  an  
administrative  review  pursuant  to  FC  §  17530.  The  
LCSA  must  address  the  issue  using  the  complaint  
resolution  time  frames.  (
FC  §  17800).  If  the  LCSA  
rejects  the  claim,  the  claimant  may  seek  a  judicial  
determination. (
FC § 17530(d)). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  When  responding  to  a  motion  
alleging  mistaken  identity,  pay  close  attention  to  the  
moving  party’s  allegation  that  he  or  she  is  not  the 
support  obligor  if  the  motion  is  based  solely  on  the  fact  
that  the  moving  party’s  name  is  different  than  the  name  
of  the  support  obligor.  The  support  obligor  could  have  
legally   changed   his   or   her   name   after   the   support   
judgment  was  entered.  (See,  e.g., FC  §  298.6 and FC 
§ 306.5)',

1. Rule 
In  dissolution  or  legal  separation  actions,  the  court  
may  set  aside  judgments  based  upon  actual  fraud,  
perjury, duress, mental incapacity, or mistake of   law 
or fact. (
FC § 2122) 
2. Required  Findings 
Before granting  relief,  the  court  is  required  to  find  
that the facts alleged as grounds for relief materially 
affected the original order and that the moving party 
would   materially   benefit   from   the   relief.   (
FC  §  
2121(b)
). 
3. Deadlines 
For actual fraud and perjury, the party must request 
relief within 1 year after the date on which the party 
discovered  or  should  have  discovered  the  fraud  or  
perjury. (
FC § 2122(a) - FC § 2122(b)) If a party is 
requesting   relief   based   upon   duress   or   mental   
incapacity,  the  party  must  file  an  action  or  motion  
within 2 years after the date of entry of judgment. (F
C 
§  2122(c)  -  FC  §  2122(d))  If  a  party  is  requesting 
relief  based  upon  mistake  of    law  or  fact,  the party 
must file an action or motion within 1 year after the 
date of entry of the judgment. (
FC § 2122(e); IRMO 
Thorne and Raccina (2012) 203 Cal.App.4
th
 492). 
4. Limits on  Set Aside 
A  judgment  may  not  be  set  aside  simply  because  a  
court  finds  that  it  was  inequitable  when  made,  nor  
because    subsequent    circumstances    caused    the    
division of   assets or   liabilities to become inequitable, 
or  the  support  to  become  inadequate.  (
FC  §  2123; 
IRMO Rosevear (1998) 65 Cal.App.4
th
 673).  
If a   court determines that relief is appropriate, then it 
shall only set aside the provisions materially affected 
by the circumstances leading to the decision to grant 
relief. However, a   court has discretion to set aside the 
entire  judgment  for  equitable  considerations.  (

J. EQUITABLE RELIEF  
1. Equitable  Relief 
If statutory relief is unavailable, courts may exercise 
equitable   powers   to   set   aside   judgments   under   
limited   circumstances.   Equitable   relief   may   be   
available where a party can show extrinsic mistake or 
extrinsic  fraud.  (Rappleyea  v.  Campbell  (1994)  8  
Cal.4
th
 975; IRMO Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d 337). 
2. Elements 
Pursuant  to  IRMO  Stevenot  (1984)  154  Cal.App.3d  
1051, a moving party must demonstrate: 
a. A meritorious case; 
b.A  satisfactory  excuse  for  not  defending  (the 
extrinsic factor); and 
c. Diligence in seeking relief once the judgment 
was discovered. 
3. Equitable  Defenses 
When  a  party  seeks  to  invoke  the  court’s  equitable  
powers,    equitable    defenses    such    as    equitable    
estoppel apply and may bar relief. (Id.) 
4. Extrinsic  and  Intrinsic  Fraud 
Under traditional principles, a party may seek relief 
based  upon  extrinsic  fraud,  but  not  intrinsic  fraud.  
(Id.) 
a. Extrinsic Fraud 
Extrinsic  fraud  occurs  when  one  party  deprives  
the other of the opportunity to present his claim 
or  defense  to  the  court  (i.e.  not  giving  notice  or  
convincing  the  other  party  the  matter  will  not  
proceed).  (City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  v.  
Cartagena (1995) 35 Cal.App.4
th
 1061). 
1) Wrong Defendant 
Plaintiff’s act of   obtaining a   default judgment 
after learning he had either named or served 
the wrong person amounts to extrinsic fraud 
or  mistake.  (Manson  v.  Black  (2009)  176  
Cal.App.4
th
 36).',

114 
 
 
b. Intrinsic Fraud 
“[F]raud  is  intrinsic  and  not  a  valid  ground  for  
setting aside a judgment when the party has been 
given   notice   of   the   action   and   has   had   an   
opportunity  to  present  his  case  and  to  protect  
himself   from   any   mistake   or   fraud   of   his   
adversary but has unreasonably neglected to do 
so.”   (City   and   County   of   San   Francisco   v.   
Cartagena (1995)  supra,  35 Cal.App.4
th
  1061, 
1067,   citing    IRMO    Stevenot,    supra,    154 
Cal.App.3d 1051, 1069). 
5. Family  Code 
FC   §   3691   appears  to   be  a codification   of    the 
equitable grounds of extrinsic fraud (
FC § 3691(a)), 
intrinsic  fraud  (
FC § 3691(b)) and defective service 
(
FC  §  3691(c)). Therefore,  courts  have  held  that  
traditional    equitable    relief    is    now    unavailable 
because 
FC § 3690 et seq. is the exclusive set-aside 
remedy.    (See    IRMO    Zimmerman    (2010)    183    
Cal.App.4
th
  900;  but  see  County  of  San  Diego  v.  
Gorham (2010)   186   Cal.App.4
th
   1215   [under   the   
“unique  circumstances  of  this  case”  the  court  found 
that  notwithstanding 
FC  §  3690  et  seq.,   equitable 
relief is available]). 
 
 PRACTICE POINT: In equity cases, look first to see 
when the party obtained actual knowledge of the 
judgment. Evidence might include contact with the 
LCSA, or payments made on the judgment. If the 
obligor did not act quickly, “equity” should not be 
available because of the undue delay (unclean hands, 
laches)    and    resulting    prejudice    to    the    county    or 
custodial parent (e.g., had the party filed his motion 
soon after discovery – even if granted – the LCSA or 
custodial parent could have established a new order). 
If the party has been paying on the judgment over a 
substantial period of time, consider equitable estoppel. 
For example, due to the party’s conduct of paying on 
the judgment (treating the judgment as valid), the party 
should be equitably estopped from now challenging 
the validity of the judgment. (IRMO Valle (1975) 53

K. INADEQUATE GROUNDS FOR RELIEF

treatment.  (Rappleyea  v.  Campbell (1994)  8   Cal.4

B. COMPETING CLAIMS TO CHILD SUPPORT 
FUNDS 
 
 
Payment of child support ordered by the court shall be 
made by the person owing the support payment before 
payment  of  any  debts  owed  to  creditors.  (
FC  §  4011) 
“Payment of   child support ordered by the court shall be 
made by the person owing the support payment before 
payment  of  any  debts  owed  to  creditors.”  (Brothers  v.  
Kern (2007)  154  Cal.App.4
th
  126 [incarcerated  father  
could not direct all his resources to his attorney, leaving 
none  for  child  support]).  However,  former  wife’s  child  
support   order   did   not   have   priority   over   victim   
restitution  in  a  “freeze  and  seize”  where  the  frozen  
assets   were   derived   from   the   defendant’s   criminal   
conduct. (People v. Mozes (2011) 192 Cal.App.4
th
 1124). 
 
 
Child support payments are intended to enable the child 
to  be  adequately  supported.  This  purpose  would  be  
frustrated  if  the  payments  were  intercepted  to  satisfy  
other debts, effectively depriving the child of   support, so 
such   interceptions   and   liens   are   not   allowed.   For   
example,   attorneys   may   not   attach   child   support   
payments  to  satisfy  a  noncustodial  parent’s  attorneys’  
fees. (Hoover-Reynolds v. Superior Court of San Diego 
(1996)     50     Cal.App.4
th
 1273).     Likewise,     support     
payments  cannot  be  intercepted  to  pay  restitution  to  a  
custodial   parent’s   victims   in   criminal   proceedings.   
(United States v. Dann (9th Cir. 2011) 652 F.3d 1160). 
C. EMPLOYERS AND EARNINGS ASSIGNMENTS   
An  earnings  assignment  is  a  statutory  procedure  by  
which a portion of   the obligor’s earnings is ordered to be 
paid by the obligor’s employer directly to the obligee to 
satisfy  a  support  obligation.  (
FC  §  5208(a)).  Prior  to  
January  1,  1994,  an  “earnings  assignment”  was  known  
as a “wage assignment.” (see former 
CC § 4390(a) and 
4390.3(a)).

When  a  court  orders  a  party  to  pay  an  amount  for  
support  or  orders  a  modification  of  the  amount  of  
support to be paid, the court shall include in its order an 
earnings   assignment   order   for   support   to   pay   the   
amount   ordered   by   the   court   for   support   plus   an   
additional amount to be paid toward the liquidation of 
any arrearage. (
FC § 5230(a)). 
All  earnings  assignment  orders  for  support  shall  be  
issued on the mandated Federal form. (FC § 5208(b)). 
In  lieu  of  an  earnings  assignment  order  signed  by  a  
judge,  a  LCSA  may  serve  on  the  employer  a  notice  of  
assignment.  (
FC  §  5246(b)).  The  LCSA  shall  use  the  
federally     mandated     form,     Income     Withholding     
Order/Notice  for  Support  (IWO).  (
FC  §  5246(c)).  The  
distinction here is that the same form has to be used in 
both IV-D and non IV-D actions, but the form in a IV-D 
action does not need to be signed by a judicial officer. 
 
 PRACTICE     POINT     Compare     an     Earnings     
Withholding  Order  (EWO)  and  an  EWO  for  Support  - 
The  EWO  procedure  of  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure 
(also  known  as  the  wage  garnishment  law  or  WGL),  
allows   a   judgment   creditor   to   enforce a   money 
judgment  against  the  unpaid  earnings  of  the  judgment  
debtor.  Under  the  EWO  process,  the  levying  officer  
issues  the  order  after  a  writ  of  execution  has  been 
issued  to  the  county  where  the  employer  is  to be 
served.  The  order  is  served  on  the  employer  by  the  
levying   officer. The   employer   then   withholds   the   
employee’s   earnings   and   pays   them   to   the   levying   
officer,  who in  turns  pays  them to  the person entitled 
to  them.  (CCP  §    706.021, 706.022, 706.025, 
706.026). 
If   the  withholding  order  is  to  collect  delinquent  support, 
it  is  called  an  “EWO  for  support”.  An  EWO  for  support 
is  statutorily  defined  as  “an  earnings  withholding  order  
issued   on   a   writ   of   execution   to   collect   delinquent   
amounts  payable under  a  judgment  for  the  support  of 
a   child,   spouse,   former   spouse of   the judgment 
debtor.”  (CCP  §  706.030(a)).  A  withholding  order  for  
support  must  be  denoted  as  such  on  its  face.  (CCP  §  
706.030(a)).  A  local child  support  agency  may  issue  a 
withholding order for support on a notice of levy',

pursuant  to  FC  §  17522  without  obtaining  a  writ  of  
execution.  (CCP  §  706.030(b)).  The  Judicial  Council  
has  prescribed  separate  forms  for  an  EWO  (WG-002), 
an application  for  such  an order  (WG-001),  and  an 
EWO for support (WG-004).

distinguished    -    The    EWO    for    support    garnishes 
earnings   only   to   collect   arrearages,   an   earnings   
assignment  operates  to  collect  both  arrearages  and  
current  support  prospectively.  See IRMO  Stutz  (1981) 
126  Cal.App.3d  1038.    Note  the  federally  mandated 
form is   titled   an   Income   Withholding Order   (IWO). 
Don’t   let   the   name   confuse,   it   is   still   an   Earnings   
Assignment if issued per FC § 5230. 
1. Employer  and  Earnings 
An “employer” is anyone who pays “earnings.” (FC 
§  5210)  “Earnings”  include  wages,  salary,  bonus,  
money,  and  benefits;  payments  due  to  independent 
contractors,   interest,   dividends,   rents,   royalties,   
residuals,  patent  rights,  mineral  or  other  natural  
resource  rights;  payments  due  from  contracts  for  
services  or  sales  whether  denominated  as  wages,  
salary,  commission  or  otherwise;  payments  from  
workers’   compensation   disability   benefits;   state   
disability  benefits;  and  any  other  payments  due  or  
credits  due  or  becoming  due,  regardless  of  source.  
(
FC § 5206). 
2. Timeframe 
Employers  are  required  to  begin  deducting  child  
support  owed  pursuant  to  an  earnings  assignment  
order within 10 days after service of the order on the 
employer. (
FC § 5233). 
3. Priority 
An   earnings   assignment   has   priority   over   any   
earnings withholding order. (
CCP §   706.031(b)). An 
IRS   tax   levy   takes   priority   over   an   earnings   
assignment  unless  the  judgment  for  support  was  
entered  prior  to  the  date  of  the  levy.  (

6334(a)(8)).',

If  there  are  multiple  assignments,  they  should  be  
honored for the full amount, up to 50 percent of the 
employee’s net earnings. If  it is more than 50 percent, 
the    employer    should    prorate    the    deductions    
according to the ratio of the various support orders. 
(
FC § 5238). 
5. Administrative  Arrears  Payments 
If  the  underlying  court  order  for  support  does  not  
include an arrears payment, the LCSA may add one. 
(
FC  §  5246(d)(2))  The  amount  specified  cannot  
exceed  the  maximum  allowed  under  
15  U.S.C.  §  
1673 (see Part 6 of   this section). If the obligor’s current 
support  obligation  terminated  by  operation  of  law,  
the LCSA may “roll down” the prior current support 
amount  adding  it  into  the  existing  arrears  payment.  
(
FC § 5246(f)). 
If  the  obligor  is  receiving  Social  Security  Disability  
Insurance     (SSDI)     and     Supplemental     Security     
Income/State  Supplementary  Payments  (SSI/SSP)  or  
would  be  receiving  SSI/SSP  benefits  but  for  excess  
income  and  meets  the  SSI  resource  test,  and  the  
obligor has supplied the LCSA with this information, 
then the arrears payment on the earnings assignment 
issued by the LCSA shall not exceed 5 percent of the 
obligor''s   total   monthly   SSDI   payments.   (
FC   §   
5246(d)(3); see also CSS Letter 04-03). 
6. Maximum  Withholding  Limits 
Congress   enacted   the   Federal   Consumer   Credit   
Protection   Act   (CCPA)   to   provide   wage   earners   
nationwide     with     uniform     protections     against     
excessive  wage  garnishments.  (
15  U.S.C.  §  1673). 
Wage withholding actions to collect support are one 
of  the  expressed  exceptions  to  the  CCPA''s  general  
rule   restricting   wage   withholding   actions   to   a   
maximum   of   25%   of   an   individual''s   disposable   
earnings.',

Under the CCPA, if the wage earner is supporting a 
spouse or dependent child (other than the spouse or 
child covered by the support order being enforced), 
then up to 50% of   this individual''s disposable income 
may be attached "to enforce any order for the support 
of   any person." If the wage earner is not supporting a 
second  family,  then  up  to  60%  of  this  individual''s  
disposable  income  may  be  attached  to  enforce  a  
support order. However, if the wage earner is more 
than twelve weeks delinquent in the payment of the 
support obligation, then the 50% and 60% ceilings are 
increased to 55% and 65% respectively. (
15 U.S.C. § 
1673(b)(2)). 
The  CCPA  limits  the  amount  of  an  individual’s  
earnings that may be subject to “garnishment” unless 
the State has laws providing wage earners with more 
protection  against  income  withholding.  There  is  no  
California  law  giving  greater  protection  to  earning  
assignments  issued  per  
FC  §  5230  over  the  CCPA.  
Thus,   California   follows   the   CCPA   for   earning   
assignments  with  one  exception.  (This  exception  is  
contained in the California Code of   Regulations at 
22 
CCR  §  116100  and  is  applicable  only  to  actions  
involving    the    LCSA. LCSAs    have    an    added    
enforcement remedy not available to non-IV-D cases 
and that is the administrative arrears payment.). 
Per 
22  CCR  §  116100,  when  the  LCSA  exercises  its  
administrative   authority   to   increase   the   arrears   
payments, the LCSA earnings assignment is limited 
to  50%  withholding  (which  is  providing  greater  
protection than the CCPA). Note that per 
22 CCR § 
116100(a)(1), (2),  if the LCSA sent out the assignment 
with   the   court   ordered   current   support   and/or   
arrears   payment   amount   (i.e.,   no   administrative   
arrears   amount),   it   is   not   limited   to   the   50%   
withholding and the CCPA limits would apply. 
 NOTE: 
22 CCR §    116100 is in direct conflict with 
FC  §    5246. FC  §    5246 specifically  provides  that',

when  the  administrative  arrears  payment  is  being  
used,  the  withholding  limit  is  the  CCPA.  (
FC  §  
5246(d)(2), (f)). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT CCP § 706.052 does  not  place 
a 50% withholding limit on an earnings assignment. 
This section addresses a restriction on the EWO for 
support when there is also an earnings assignment in 
place at the same time for the same obligor. See the 
Law Revision Comments for greater explanation and 
examples. See also CCP § 706.031(a) which states 
“Nothing in  this  chapter  affects  an earnings 
assignment order for support.” 
7. No  Credit  Unless  Payment  is   Received 
The obligor is responsible to ensure wage assignment 
payment deducted from his/her paycheck is received 
by the IV-D agency. (See County of Shasta v. Smith 
(1995)   38   Cal.App.4
th
   329 [employer   deducted   
money from obligor’s paycheck, but never sent it to 
the LCSA; the loss was the obligor’s, not the child’s]). 
8. Penalties     for     Failure     to     Honor     Earnings     
Assignment 
a. If money was not deducted from the employee’s 
pay  after  service  of  a  valid  assignment,  the  
employer is liable to the obligee for the amount 
that   should   have   been   collected,   including   
interest.  (
FC  §  5241(a)).  This  would  require  
joining  the  employer  to  your  action  or  filing  of  
an independent action.
 
b. 
If money has been deducted, but not sent in, the 
employer  is  liable  to  the  obligee  for  interest  
charges  as  a  result.  (
FC  §  5241(b)).  The  LCSA  
shall   take   appropriate   action   to   collect   the   
withheld   sums   from   the   employer.   (
FC   §   
5241(d)).   Such   actions   could   include   LCSA   
contact  with  the  employer  via  phone  and  or  
letter.    The    obligor    should    be    referred    to    
California  Labor  Commissioner’s  Office  or  the  
District Attorney’s Office. A Small Claims action 
could also be considered.',

c. A  civil  contempt  (CCP  §  1209)  may  be  filed  
against   an   employer   who   willfully   fails   to   
comply   with   an   assignment   order.   (
FC   §   
5241(c)). 
d. 
FC §   5241 also provides for a system of   penalties 
on employers for failure to honor an assignment 
order.  LCSAs  are  not  required  to  establish  or  
collect these penalties on behalf of the obligee.
 
D. LICENSE SUSPENSION OR DENIAL  
FC  §  17520  details  the  process  for  LCSAs  to  submit  
obligors’  names  for  license  suspension  and  release.  It  
also  allows  obligors  to  file  a  “timely”  written  request  
with the LCSA and/or a  motion with the court to review 
a release of the license. 
When  the  LCSA  is  reviewing  for  release,  listed  below  
are suggested items to consider. Remember, you are in 
the  driver’s  seat  until  you  sign  the  release.  However, 
you should remain reasonable. 
a. Amount of   current support 
b. Amount of   arrears 
c. Payment history 
d. Obligor''s family and financial circumstances 
e. Needs of   the obligee and child(ren) 
f. Ability   to   comply   with   the   payment   schedule

LCSA’s decision. The court’s review is limited to the 
following: a.) Existence of a   support obligation owed 
by  the  applicant,  b.)  Compliance  with  the  order,  c.)  
Additional facts which warrant a   conditional release. 
The court may do one of   the following: a.) Uphold the 
local  child  support agency''s  decision  not  to release, 
b.)   Grant   an   unconditional   release,   c.)   Grant   a   
conditional release. 
If  the  court  grants  a  conditional  release,  the  court  
shall   state   its   basis   and   make   findings   of   fact   
concerning:  a.)  Needs  of  the  obligor,  b.)  Payment  
history, c.) Current circumstances of the obligor and 
obligee,   d.)   Payments   necessary   to   satisfy   the   
unrestricted  release,  e.)  Payment  terms,  compliance  
of   which is necessary, to allow the conditional release 
to remain in effect. 
If  an  obligor  is  caught  driving  with  a  suspended  
license  and  the  suspension  or  revocation  was  under  
this  section,  the  obligor''s  vehicle  is  not  subject  to  
impoundment. 
FC  §  17520  (w)(1) However,  this  
does not limit the impoundment for other reasons. 
Suspension  of  a  driver''s  license  under  this  section  
(formerly  W&I  Code  §  11350.6)  does  not  violate  a  
support    obligor''s    constitutional    right    to    equal    
protection  or  to  travel.  (Tolces  v.  Trask (1999)  76

E. BANK LEVIES  
LCSAs are required to submit obligors who owe arrears 
to the Department for collection. This process is known 
as the Financial Institution Data Match System (FIDM). 
(
FC § 17453). 
1. Orders  to  Withhold  (OTW) 
The  FIDM  matches  a  financial  institution  with  an  
obligor  who  owes  arrears.  The  Department  then  
serves  an  OTW  on  the  institution  seeking  the  full  
amount of   arrears. The institution must transmit all',

available  funds,  up  to  the  full  amount,  to  the  State  
Disbursement   Unit   (SDU)   no   earlier   than   ten   
business   days   after   receipt   of   the   OTW.   (
FC  §  
17454(d)).   The   institution   must   also   notify   the   
obligor of   the OTW by mail. (
FC § 17456(b)); IRMO 
LaMoure 
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4
th
 807, 816-18). 
2. Automatic  Exemption 
An obligor automatically receives a   $3,500 exemption 
(
FC § 17453(j)) if, at the time of the OTW: 
a. The obligor  is  in  compliance  with  the  court 
ordered arrears payment;
 
b. 
The  obligor  is  paying  current  and  past  support  
through a wage assignment; or
 
c. 
The obligor  is  paying 50%  of    their  earnings 
toward support.
 
Such an obligor is a “compliant obligor” and CSE will 
issue  an  Exempt  Order  to  Withhold  (EOTW).  An  
obligor  who  falls  into  one  of  these  categories  is  still  
subject  to  the  OTW  procedure,  but  automatically  
receives a   $3,500 exemption without filing a   Claim of 
Exemption (COE). (
FC § 17453(j)). The EOTW itself 
instructs  the  financial  institution  to  automatically  
exempt the first $3,500 in the account. Anything over 
$3,500 is transmitted to the SDU. 
3. Claim  of  Exemption  (COE) 
Compliant  Obligor  -  Although  the  first  $3,500  is  
automatically  exempt  without  the  need  to  make  a  
claim, an additional claim may be made based solely 
on  hardship  for  obligor  and  obligor’s  dependents.  
(
FC §   17453(j)(3) and FC §   17453(j)(7)). The COE 
shall include a   financial statement. (
CCP §   703.530). 
Non-Compliant  Obligor  –  An  obligor  who  does  not  
meet  the  
FC  §  17453(j)(1)  criteria  can  still  serve  a  
COE on the LCSA.

obligor  must  indicate  which  statutory  exemption  
they are relying on. (
CCP § 703.520(b)(5)). 
The obligor must serve the COE on the LCSA within 
10 days after the OTW is served on the obligor. (
CCP 
§  703.520
)  An  untimely  COE  results  in  a  waiver,  
even if the property is exempt. (
CCP § 703.030(a)). 
This means that even exempt property is not exempt 
without  filing  a  COE.  Compare  “exempt”  property  
with  property  that  is  “exempt  without  making  a  
claim.” (
CCP § 703.030(b)). 
The  LCSA  is  required  to  review  the  COE  and,  if  
appropriate, file a noticed motion to oppose the claim 
within 10 days. (
FC § 17453(j)(5), CCP § 703.550) 
The LCSA must release the withheld funds if it fails 
to file the motion within 10 days. (
CCP § 703.550). 
At the hearing, the obligor/claimant bears the burden 
of  proof.  (
CCP  §  703.580(b)).  Even  if  exempt,  the  
property may still be applied to the satisfaction of a 
support judgment. (
CCP § 703.070(b)). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  If  a  notice  of  opposition  to  the  
COE  is  filed,  be  sure  to  contact  the  financial  institution 
to  delay  the  remittance  of  the  funds  until  after  the  court  
hearing  and  ensure  that  a  disbursement  hold  is  placed  
on the case. 
4. No  Levy  for Obligors  Receiving  SSDI

a disabled child support obligor who qualifies for or 
actually  receives  SSI/SSP  or  SSDI  (and  meets  the  
federal SSI income test) is  exempt from levy.  In Lak 
v.  Lak  (2020)  50  Cal.App.5th  581,  the  4th  DCA  held  
that Hopkins oversimplified   the   exemption.    To 
become  exempt,  a  support  obligor  is  required  to  
establish  they  also  satisfy  the  SSI  resource  test  and  
would  have  qualified  for  SSI  but  for  the  SSI  income  
test, in addition to proving they receive SSDI benefits.

F. QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDERS 
(QDROS) 
Financial  Institution  Data  Match  (FIDM)  statutory  
framework is not required. 
 
 
A   "qualified   domestic   relation   order"   (QDRO)   is   a   
domestic  relations  order  that  creates  or  recognizes  the  
existence  of  an  alternate  payee''s  right  to  receive,  or  
assigns to an alternate payee the right to receive, all or   a 
portion   of   the   benefits   payable   with   respect   to   a   
participant  under  an  employer  sponsored  retirement  
plan,  and  that  includes  certain  information  and  meets  
certain  other  requirements.  (
29  USC  §  1056(d)(3)(B); 
IRC § 414(p)(1)(A)). 
QDROs are authorized under the Employee Retirement 
Income  Security  Act  (ERISA).  (
29  USC  §  1056(d)(3); 
IRC §   414(p)). Whenever there is a   child and/or spousal 
support   obligation   arising   from   a   state   domestic   
relations  law,  a  QDRO  may  potentially  be  used  to  
enforce the support obligation. 
1. Defined   Contribution   Plans   and   Lump-Sum 
QDROs 
These   are   voluntary,   employer-sponsored   ERISA   
retirement plans that include 401(k) retirement plans 
and     403(b)     Annuity     plans,     Employee     Stock     
Ownership  Plans  (ESOP)  and  Profit-Sharing  Plans.  
QDROs against these plans are the easiest to draft by 
IV-D  programs  and  are  typically  used  to  collect  
lump-sum distributions. 
2. Defined  Benefit Plans 
These plans are non-voluntary, employer sponsored 
ERISA     retirement     plans     which     contain     no     
mechanism for IV-D programs to request lump-sum 
collections.  In  most  instances,  an  IWO  against  the 
plan  is  effective  if  the  obligor  is  already  drawing  
benefits.',

For  purposes  of  the  QDRO,  an  alternate  payee  can

follows: 
[T]he  fact  that  a  domestic  relations  order  names  
[DCSS] as the party to whom payments are to be 
made on behalf of an alternate payee, would not 
constitute grounds on which a plan administrator 
could find the order not to be qualified.

4. ERISA-Exempt  Government  Retirement  Plans 
Government  sponsored  plans  are  generally  exempt  
from  ERISA  and  not  subject  to  QDROs. 
CCP  § 
704.110 
authorizes  the  intercept  of  lump  sum  and  
periodic     payment     distributions     from     public     
retirement  systems  to  satisfy  judgments.  PERS  and  
STRS   have   their   own   procedure   for   division   of   
employee (member) interests in the event of   a   marital 
dissolution. 
5. Request  for Employer  Information 
Under 
FC    §    17512,     employers     and     labor     
organizations   are   required   to   provide   relevant   
employment and income information that they have 
in    their    possession    to    the    LCSA.    Relevant    
employment  and  income  information  shall  include,  
but is not be limited to, information on other earnings 
as  specified  in  
FC  §  5206.  Pursuant  to  FC  §  5206, 
“earnings”  includes  “any  other  payments  or  credits  
due or becoming due, regardless of source.” A QDRO 
discovery letter can be sent to California employers, 
however, State IV-D programs are required to use the 
federal   administrative   subpoena   for   out-of  -state 
employers. (

plan,  as  well  as  the  exact  name  of  the  plan  and  the  
contact    information    for    the    employer’s    plan    
administrator. 
A plan  administrator  is  the  person  or  company  the  
employer  selects  to  manage  its  retirement  savings  
plan. The administrator works with the plan provider 
to    ensure    that    the    plan    meets    government    
regulations. The plan administrator is responsible for 
approving or   rejecting your QDRO.  If approved, the 
plan administrator will distribute payment from the 
plan in accordance with the terms of the QDRO. 
 
 PRACTICE POINT:   Since   the Plan   Administrator 
must  ultimately  approve  your  QDRO,  contact  the  Plan  
Administrator   early   in   the   process. Submit   a   draft 
QDRO   to   the Plan   Administrator   for   review   and 
approval  prior  to  filing  it  with  the  court.  Ask  the  Plan  
Administrator   to   place   a   hold   on   the   participant’s   
retirement   account   while   the QDRO   is   processed, 
some  may  require  a  letter  of  adverse  interest  or  a  draft  
QDRO  before they  place  a hold of  up to 180 days. 
A federal administrative subpoena can be served on 
the  plan  administrator  prior  to  submitting  a  QDRO  
for information on the participant’s account balance. 
Since  all  plan  administrators  charge  fees  to  review  
QDROs, it is useful to know the plan account balance 
before deciding whether to proceed with a QDRO. 
 
 NOTE: FC § 17512(d) requires the LCSA to send 
a notice that a request for this information has been 
made to the last known address of   the person who is 
the subject of   the inquiry. The federal administrative 
subpoena does not have the same notice requirement 
when  used  to  request  information  from  a  financial  
institution. (
GC § 7480(l)). 
6. QDRO Form 
QDRO  Forms  FL-460  and  FL-461  are  available  in  
CSE.  QDRO  Forms  FL-460  and  FL-461  are  intended  
for  use  when  a  Plan  Participant  is  already  in  pay  
status.  If  the  Participant  is  not  in  pay  status  at  the',

time  the  Plan  receives  these  forms,  then  the  Plan  is  
only  required  to  send  notice  that  no  benefits  are  
currently available for distribution. 
Most Plans have a   model QDRO form available upon 
request. However, there is no specific form required. 
Pursuant  to  
29  USC  §  1056(d)(3)(c),  a  QDRO  will  
meet the requirements so long as it contains: (1) the 
name and address of   the Plan Participant and named 
Alternate  Payee(s);  (2)  the  amount  or  percentage  of  
the  Participant’s  benefit  to  be  paid  to  the  Alternate  
Payee(s)  and  the  manner  in  which  that  amount  or  
percentage  is  to  be  determined;  (3)  the  number  of  
payments or   period to which the order applies; and 
(4) the name of   each Plan to which the order applies. 
A  QDRO  cannot  require  a  Plan  to  provide  a  benefit  
that  is  not  otherwise  provided  under  the  Plan,  or  
increase benefits, or require that benefits be paid to a 
new  alternate  payee  if  the  Plan  is  required  to  pay  
those benefits to a   different alternate payee pursuant 
to a prior QDRO. (
29 USC § 1056(d)(3)(D)). 
 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   Many   plans   “require”   use of 
their model  QDRO,  but  these  model  QDROs  do  not  
usually  comport  with  the  requirements  of  IV-D  child  
support   QDROs.   LCSAs   should   generate   a   QDRO   
pleading specifically tailored to the unique 
requirements   of   IV-D   enforcement   actions.   Model   
QDROs  are  available,  reach  out  to  other  LCSAs  for  
samples if necessary. 
 
7. Tax Consequences 
To   ensure the obligor   is   solely   liable   for   taxes 
stemming  from  LCSA  submitted  QDROs,  name  the 
Children  as  the  Alternate  Payees  of  any  IV-D  child  
support  QDRO.  Pursuant  to  
IRC  §  3405(b)(1),  the  
obligor  shall  be  subject  to  a  10%  tax-withholding 
from  funds  distributed.  No  taxation  liability  will  
attach to the obligee/alternate payee. 
 NOTE:  The  additional  10%  penalty  for  early  
withdrawal  prior  to  age  59½  does  not  apply  to  a',

QDRO pursuant to IRC § 72(t)(2)(C). 
 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   All   Plans   charge   a   fee   for   
processing  a  QDRO.  The  fee  is  charged  against  the  
funds   prior   to   distribution and can be   substantial. 
Always  inquire  about  the  fee  before  proceeding  with  a  
QDRO  to  ensure  the  remaining  balance  after  tax  and  
fees  is  sufficient  to  justify  issuing the QDRO. 
8. Limitations  on  QDROs 
A  QDRO  can  only  divide  a  member’s  interests;  it  
cannot   offer   any   benefit   not   available   to   the   
participant.  For  example,  if  the  member  could  not  
access  the  account  until  age  65,  the  alternate  payee  
cannot receive a benefit before that time. 
9. Caution  -  Potential Property  Division  Issues 
Prior  to  generating  a  child  support  QDRO,  verify  
there  are  no  unresolved  property  division  issues  
stemming from a dissolution action. Verify there are 
no   other   outstanding   claims   to   the   retirement   
benefits,  particularly  by  the  CP  or  the  Participant’s  
present spouse who may hold a   community property 
interest in the Participant’s retirement funds. 
10. PERS  Intercept 
FC § 17528 allows for implementation of an intercept 
program  whereby  any  payments  distributed  from  a  
PERS account, whether lump sum or periodic, will be 
intercepted for unpaid child support. The lump sum 
payout  intercept  would  act  as  a  lien  for  the  full  
amount owing, while the periodic payment intercept 
would    be    subject    to    the    earnings    assignment    
exemption
 limitations of CCP  § 706.052. The 
Department currently has an interface with PERS to 
match   participants,   from   which   the   Department   
produces  a  list  for  LCSAs  to  manually  generate  the  
IWO.  This  interface  will  be  incorporated  into  CSE  
and updated monthly. STRS has not been included in 
this data-sharing legislation.

Individual   Retirement   Accounts   (IRAs)   are   not   
employer   sponsored   retirement   plans.   While   an   
employer    can    set    up    payroll    deductions    for    
contributions into an employee’s IRA, the IRA is not 
subject   to   ERISA   protections.    A   QDRO   is   not   
required to collect from an IRA. Since these accounts 
are  not  governed  by  ERISA,  all  withdrawals  are  
subject to a   10% early withdrawal penalty, including 
withdrawals   by   levy   for   the   payment   of   child   
support. 
IRA funds are exempt but only to the extent they are 
necessary  to  provide  for  the  support  of  the  account  
holder  and/or  their  spouse  or  dependents  CCP 
§ 
704.115(e). 
It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that  
funds  from  an  ERISA  protected  plan  that  are  rolled  
over  into  an  IRA  maintain  full  creditor  protection  
under  CA  law  (McMullen  v.  Haycock  (2007)  147  
Cal.App.4

753).  This  suggests  that  a  QDRO  would  
be required to collect from an IRA funded with funds 
from an ERISA protected plan. 
G. DEBTOR’S EXAMINATIONS  
Debtor’s examinations and third-party examinations are 
allowed  under  
CCP  §  708.110  and CCP  §  708.120. 
There  is  a  statutory  150-mile  limit  on  the  service  of  a  
debtor’s examination. (
CCP §    708.160) Personal service 
of   the hearing notice must be made at least 10 days prior 
to  the  hearing.  (
CCP  §  708.110).  The  service  of  the  
debtor’s  examination  creates  a  lien  on  the  debtor’s  
personal property for one year. (
CCP § 708.110(d)). 
1. Turnover  Order 
At the conclusion of   a debtor’s examination, the court 
may order the debtor’s interest in property under the 
control  of  the  debtor  or  a  third  person  be  applied  
toward the satisfaction of   the money judgment if the 
property  is  not  exempt.  (
CCP  §  708.205)  A  debtor  
may  claim  an  exemption,  but  if  the  debtor  fails  to  
raise a claim of exemption prior to the Court issuing 
the  turnover  order,  any  claim  of  exemption  that',

might have been raised is waived. (Imperial Bank v. 
Pim Electric, Inc. (1995) 33 Cal.App.4
th
 540). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  In  the  great  majority  of  cases,  a  
turnover  order  will  be  limited  to  cash  or  checks  in  the  
debtor’s  possession.  In  the  case  of  checks written  to 
the debtor,  have the  court  order  the judgment  debtor 
to  cash  the  check,  pay  a  sum  certain  to  the  LCSA,  and  
return to  the  court  with   a  receipt  for  the payment. 
Failure to return with the proof is a direct contempt. 
2. Self-Incrimination 
An  obligor  cannot  rely  on  his/her  refusal  to  pay  
support to invoke the Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination   (because   it   might   lead   to   a   
contempt      proceeding)      to      protect      financial      
information  that  could  be  utilized  to  collect  arrears  
owed. (IRMO Sachs (2002) 95 Cal.App.4
th
 1144). 
H. ORDERS FOR DEPOSIT OF MONEY OR ASSETS   
The  court  may  order  a  parent  required  to  pay  child  
support to deposit money or   assets to secure future child 
support. (
FC § 4550 et seq.). 
1. Child  Support  Security  Deposits 
In  cases  where  the  defendant  has  money  or  liquid  
assets now, but may not in the future (self-employed, 
commission-only   sales,   lottery   winners,   personal   
injury settlement recipients, etc.), the court may order 
the obligor to open a   “child support security deposit” 
bank account. (
FC §   4560; JCF FL-400 and JCF FL- 
401
). 
2. Order for  Deposit of  Assets 
The obligor may be ordered to deposit assets equal to 
the value of   one year of   support or $6,000, whichever 
is less. (
FC § 4614). The court may allow a bond or 
undertaking to be posted to satisfy this requirement. 
(
FC § 4615). 
3. Good  Cause  for Reasonable  Security 
The  court  has  the  discretion  to  order  the  obligor  to  
give “reasonable  security”  for  child  support,  upon  
showing  of  good  cause.  (
FC  §  4012).  This  code',

th

I. WRIT    OF    EXECUTION    /    ADMINISTRATIVE 
NOTICE OF LEVY 
 
 
Support may be enforced by writ of execution or notice 
of levy without prior court approval. (
FC § 5100). 
1. Writ of Execution 
The application for a writ of   execution is made to the 
clerk  of  the  court  where  the  judgment  was  entered  
and must include an affidavit of   the overdue support, 
including  the  accrued  interest,  the  amount  of  each  
installment as it became due, and the date it became 
due. (
FC § 5104) 
The  application  is  drafted  on  pleading  paper  and  
includes an audit as an exhibit. The clerk “issues” the 
writ  by  signing  and  dating  the  complete  writ  form  
and affixes the court seal. The court clerk is obligated 
to give priority to the application for, and issuance of, 
writs  of  execution  on  orders  or  judgments  for  child  
support  and  spousal  support.  A  separate  writ  is  
required for each county where a levy is to be made. 
(
CCP  §  699.510(a)).   Once   issued,   the   writ   and   
affidavit are then provided to the levying officer who 
then issues a Notice of   Levy. The LCSA can act as and 
perform  the  duties  of  the  levying  officer.  
CCP  §  
689.040(a)) 
2. Administrative  Notice  of  Levy 
FC  §  17522  lays  out  a  process  that  once  complete,  
allows  the  LCSA  to  issue  a  Notice  of  Levy.   This 
process   eliminates   the   need   to   obtain   a   writ   of   
execution from the court clerk.',

 PRACTICE  POINT:  Following  all  the  steps  in  FC  §  
17522  to  get  to  the point  to  issue  the administrative 
levy  is  a  lengthy  process.  If  time  is  of  the  essence,  it 
may  be  faster  to  obtain  a  writ  of  execution  and  issue 
your   own notice   of   levy as   the levying   officer, 
especially   since   the   court   clerk   will   give   your   writ   
application priority. 
J. LIEN ON PENDING CIVIL ACTION  
CCP § 708.410 allows a lien to be filed in pending civil 
actions. Consider this lien if you have information that 
the  obligor  is  suing  an  employer,  getting  a  personal  
injury settlement, getting an equalization payment in a 
dissolution action from the “new” spouse, is an heir in a 
probate  action,  etc.  The  obligor  only  has  to  have  an  
interest in money or   property, the obligor does not need 
to  be  a  plaintiff.  (Oldham  v.  California  Capital  Fund,  
Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4
th
 421). 
1. Priorities 
CC §   2897 states the priority of   liens is based on time 
of creation. All other things being equal, contractual 
liens established prior to the filing of   a   child support 
lien   have   priority.   (Wujcik   v.   Wujcik (1994)   21   
Cal.App.4
th
  1790; Cappa  v.  F  &  K  Rock  and  Sand,  
Inc. (1988)   203   Cal.App.3d   172   [personal   injury   
attorney’s  lien  had  priority  over  the  child  support  
lien]). 
2. Medical  Lien 
Most personal injury cases have liens from attorneys 
and medical providers that will predate the support 
lien. If there is any money going to the obligor, file a 
lien.  Most  medical  service  providers  discount  their  
liens by 20 to 40 percent on disbursement. If feasible 
to do so, a   best practice is to request copies of   all liens 
the personal injury attorney wants to pay before the 
support  lien  and  information  regarding  how  much  
each creditor is requesting.',

135 
 
 
 
 
 PRACTICE    POINT:    Often    the    personal    injury    
attorney  will  call  and  say,  “if  you  don’t  lower  your  lien, 
the  obligor  will  get  nothing  and  therefore  he  will  not  
settle.”  Ask  the  attorney  to  ask  all  claimants  to  reduce  
their liens, including the attorney lien. 
K. LABOR UNION MEMBERS  
If the defendant is a union member and the labor union 
will not cooperate with the LCSA in providing new job 
information, the union can be joined as a   party to get an 
order requiring the union to provide work site and pay 
information. (IRMO Wilson (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 720). 
L. COMMUNITY PROPERTY ASSETS  
Community  property  assets  are  liable  for  prior  non- 
community  debts.  (FC § 910(a)).  This  includes  a  child  
or spousal support obligation that does not arise out of 
the  marriage,  which  is  to  be  treated  as  a  debt  incurred  
before  marriage.  (
FC  §  915).  The  non-obligor  spouse  
may  have  a  right  of  reimbursement  against  the  obligor  
spouse,  but  that  is  not  relevant  to  the  execution.  This  
issue  arises  when  FIDM  hits  a  community  joint  bank  
account  of  the  obligor  and  new  spouse  or  when  a  real  
estate  lien  is  activated  by  an  attempted  sale.  (Lezine  v.

M.  FRAUDULENT  CONVEYANCES  (CC  §  3439  ET  
SEQ.) 
 
Under  California’s  enactment  of  the  Uniform  Voidable  
Transactions Act (UVTA), a   transfer can be invalid when 
a debtor made the transfer with actual intent to hinder, 
delay,  or  defraud  any  creditor.  (
CC  §  3439.04(a)(1);

 PRACTICE     POINT:     The     Uniform     Voidable     
Transactions  Act  went  into  effect  on  January  1,  2016,  
replacing   the   Uniform   Fraudulent   Transfer   Act.   The   
changes  include  clarification  regarding  the  burden  of  
proof,  modification of  definitions,  and replacement  of 
the term “fraudulent” with the term “voidable.” 
N. PASSPORT DENIAL  
Upon certification by a   state agency that an obligor owes 
child support arrears exceeding $2,500, the United States 
Secretary of State shall refuse to issue a passport to the 
obligor,  and  may  revoke,  restrict  or  limit  a  passport 
previously issued to the obligor. (
42 USC § 652(k)). 
1. Withdrawal  of  Passport  Denial 
For an individual who owes more than the threshold, 
denial is mandatory. Names can be withdrawn under 
two    provisions:    erroneous    submissions    (wrong    
person)   and   certified   life   and   death   situations   
involving  an  immediate  family  member.  (See OCSS 
Letter   DCL   06-32   and   DCL   00-79,   available   at:   
www.acf.hhs.gov; CSS Letter 07-20). 
2. No  Jurisdiction  for Court  Review 
LCSAs   do   not   have   control   over   the   denial   of   
passports – the obligation is merely to report. Under 
the   separation-of  -powers   doctrine,   the   judiciary   
cannot prevent the executive from enforcing the law, 
unless the law is unconstitutional. (
Cal. Const. Art. 
III §   3). The reporting requirement has been upheld 
against      numerous      constitutional      challenges.      
(Eunique v. Powell (9th Cir. 2002) 302 F.3d 971, 974; 
Weinstein  v.  Albright  (2nd  Cir.  2001)  261  F.3d  127).  
Therefore, the trial court lacks the authority to order 
the LCSA to withdraw its mandated reporting of an 
obligor who owes more than $2,500 in arrears. 
O. EVASION OF SUPPORT  
Anyone  who  knowingly  assists  an  obligor  who  has  
unpaid  child  support  to  avoid  paying  court  ordered  
support   is   liable   for   three   times   the   value   of   the',

assistance  provided.  (CC  §  1714.4  and CC  §  1714.41). 
The amount assessed a co-conspirator is a   penalty and is 
not applied to the child support debt. 
Conduct  that  constitutes  aiding  and  abetting  includes  
failing  to  report  hiring  an  obligor  and  failing  to  report  
wages paid to an obligor to EDD. (
CC § 1714.41). 
P. PERSONAL PROPERTY LIENS  
A  lien  against  the  support  obligor’s  personal  property  
arises  by  operation  of  law  for  all  amounts  of  unpaid  
support  when  a  LCSA  is  enforcing  pursuant  to  
FC  §  
17400 and FC  §  17402.  (FC  §  17523)  The  lien  is  
perfected by filing a   notice of   child support lien with the 
Secretary  of  State  pursuant  to  
CCP  §  697.510.  Once  
filed,  it  has  the  same  force,  effect  and  priority  as  a  
personal  property  judgment  lien.  The  judgment  lien  
continues for five years unless a   continuation statement 
is timely filed. (CCP § 697.510(b)). 
Q. VETERAN’S BENEFITS  
A    former    military    service    member    may    receive    
payments  from  the  branch  of  the  armed  service  for  
which    service    was    provided    and/or    from    the    
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
1. Military  Retirement  Pay 
a. Eligibility 
Minimum  length  of  required  service  (generally  
20  years,  at  least  10  of  which  have  been  active  
service). A servicemember can also be medically 
retired, which does not require 20 years of   service 
but   generally   requires   a   standard   schedule   
disability rating of   at least 30 percent, and would 
earn them payments from their branch of   service 
as opposed to the VA. This is  treated the same as 
“regular”  military  retirement  (can be  garnished, 
is taxable, etc.) (
10 USC § 3911, 10 USC §   6323,

659(h)(1)(A)(ii)(II)
). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT: When  a  veteran  is  eligible  to  
receive  both  military  retired  pay  and  service-connected 
disability  compensation,  federal  law  limits,  in  certain  
cases,   the   total   amount   of   the   combined   benefit 
payment.  (10  USC  §  1414).  In  these circumstances, 
the  veteran  may  elect  to  waive  a  portion  of  his/her  
taxable  military  retired  pay  in  exchange  for  an  equal  
amount   of   additional,   non-taxable,   service-connected 
disability compensation benefit. This 
waived/exchanged amount  is  subject  to  garnishment 
to     enforce     a     support     order.     (42     USC     §     
659(h)(1)(A)(ii)(V); CCP  §  483.013).  The  remaining  
amount    (representing    the    unadulterated    disability    
compensation)  is  not  enforceable  by  levy,  attachment, 
or   seizure   before   or   after   payment.   (38   USC   §   
5301(a)(1)). 
2.  VA Disability Compensation (service- 
connected) 
a. Eligibility 
Veteran disability incurred or aggravated during 
military service (i.e., service connected). (
38 USC 
§ 1110). 
b. Taxability 
Generally,  exempt  from  taxation. (
38  USC  § 
5301(a)(1)). 
c. Enforceability 
Generally,  not  subject  to  garnishment  before 
payment to the veteran. (

659(h)(1)(A)(ii)(V) and 42 USC §  
659(h)(1)(B)(iii); CCP §   483.013).',

 PRACTICE   POINT:   When   you   obtain   an 
order  against  a  veteran  who  receives  service- 
connected  disability,  be  sure  to  explain  that  the  
support  will not  be paid by  wage assignment 
and  the  obligor  needs  to  pay  support  directly  to  
the  LCSA.  Contempt  may  be  appropriate  for  
failure to   pay   in   these   cases   because the 
obligor  has  the  ability  to  pay  from  the  monthly  
benefit. 
 
d. Apportionment 
When   the   veteran   receives   only   the   service- 
connected disability benefit, the VA is not bound 
by    a    garnishment,    but    can    apportion    the    
veteran’s   benefit   payment   upon   request.   (
38 
CFR §   3.450
). Where hardship is shown to exist, 
the   benefits   may   be   specially   apportioned   
between  the  veteran  and  his  or  her  dependents  
based on the facts of the case. (
38 CFR § 3.451). 
e. Enforcement After Payment 
“Although  veterans’  disability  benefits  may  be  
exempt   from   attachment   while   in   the   VA’s   
hands,  once  they  are  delivered  to  the  veteran  a  
state court can require that they be used to satisfy 
a   child support order.” (Rose v. Rose (1987) 481 
U.S.  619,  620).  This  case  involved  a  contempt  
proceeding against a veteran obligor whose sole 
income   was   derived   from   service-connected 
disability benefits. The Supreme Court held that 
the  Tennessee  statute  that  allowed  a  court  to  
order a veteran to make child support payments 
from   his   service-connected   disability   benefits   
was not preempted by the federal statute giving 
the  Secretary  of  the  Veteran’s  Administration  
authority   to   apportion   the   same   benefits   on   
behalf of the veteran’s children. (Id. at 628). 
f. Derivative Benefits 
Children of a recipient may be eligible for direct 
benefits based on an obligor’s award of veteran’s 
benefits. 
FC § 4504 requires the custodial parent',

or  other  obligee  to  apply  for  derivative  benefits  
after notification of   possible eligibility. If benefits 
are received by the custodial parent, the obligor 
gets credit toward the support obligation. 
3. VA Disability  Pension  (non-service  connected) 
a. Eligibility 
An  obligor  who  served  during  a  period  of  war,  
and was either permanently and totally disabled 
from   a   nonservice-connected   disability   and   
meets certain income requirements OR age 65 or 
older, may be eligible for a VA pension. (
38 USC 
§ 1513 and 38 USC § 1521). 
b. Taxability 
Generally,  a  VA  disability  pension  is  exempt 
from taxation. (
38 USC § 5301(a)(1) 
c. Enforceability 
Not  enforceable by  levy, attachment  or    seizure 
before or after payment to the veteran. (
38 USC 
§ 5301(a)(1)). 
d. Not Considered Income 
Because   nonservice-connected   VA   Disability   
Pension benefits are based on a determination of 
need,  these  benefits  are  not  considered  income  
for child support purposes. (
FC § 4058(c)). 
R. PRIVATE CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTORS  
All  child  support  orders  entered  on  or  after  January  1,  
2010   must   contain   language   requiring   the   support   
obligor to pay a   fee to the private child support collector 
under certain conditions. (

VII. ARREARS  
A. NO RETROACTIVE MODIFICATION  
A support order may not be modified or terminated as 
to an amount that accrued before the date of   the filing of 
the motion to modify. (
FC § 3651(c)(1)). 
1. Reservation  of  Jurisdiction 
A court may not retroactively modify support based 
on  a  reservation  of  jurisdiction  in  a  previous  order,  
where the underlying motion has been taken off the 
calendar.  (IRMO  Gruen  (2011)  191  Cal.App.4
th
  627 
[The court could not modify temporary support that 
accrued before the date of filing the notice of   motion 
pursuant  to  
FC  §  3603.])  However,  this  does  not  
preclude   a   trial   court   from   expressly   reserving   
jurisdiction  to  amend  a  non-final  order  as  to  two  
months    of    support    based    on    the    anticipated    
presentation  of  additional  evidence.  (IRMO  Frietas  
(2012) 209 Cal.App.4
th
 1059). 
2. Interest on  Arrears 
Courts  do  not  have  discretion  to  abate  or  forgive  
interest  on  arrears,  as  this  would  be  a  retroactive  
modification   of   support.   (IRMO  Perez  (1995)   35   
Cal.App.4
th
 77). 
3. Incarceration 
The trial court lacks equitable power to forgive child 
support  arrears  because  retroactive  modification  is  
statutorily barred. (County of Santa Clara v. Wilson 
(2003)     111     Cal.App.4
th
 1324;     See     however     
FC§4009.5 for incarcerated obligors and suspension 
of child support.) 
4. Child Care  Expenses 
A court may not relieve a   parent of   childcare support 
orders  regardless  of  whether  the  childcare  amount  
ordered exceeded the actual childcare costs incurred. 
(IRMO   Tavares   (2007)   151   Cal.App.4
th
   620, 626 
[citing 
FC § 3692];  For  further  explanation,  see also

retroactivity  provision  over  the  childcare  portion  of  
the  order,  holding  the  provision  violated  statutory  
prohibitions   against   retroactive   modification   of   
support.  An  obligor  has  a  duty  to  file  a  motion  to  
adjust  the  support  prospectively  if  they  believe  the  
childcare amount no longer applies. (
FC §   3653 (a)). 
B. LACHES  
Laches  is  not  a  defense  against  the  enforcement  of  
arrears  owed  to  the  custodial  parent.  “In  an  action  to  
enforce a   judgment for child, family, or   spousal support, 
the defendant may raise, and the court may consider, the 
defense of laches only with respect to any portion of the 
judgment  that  is  owed  to  the  state.”  (FC  §  291(d))  This  
law is applied retroactively as detailed in IRMO Fellows 
(2006) 39 Cal.4
th
 179. 
C. EQUITABLE CREDIT TOWARDS ARREARS  
If  an  obligor  assumes  custody  of  the  child  with  the  
consent  of  the  previous  custodial  party,  and  the  court  
finds   that   the   obligor   has   met   their   child   support   
obligation  due  to  having  custody,  the  court  has  the  
discretion  to  grant  the  obligor  equitable  credit  for  the  
period that the obligor had custody of the child. (Jackson 
v.  Jackson (1975)  51  Cal.App.3d  363; IRMO  Trainotti 
(1989) 212  Cal.App.3d  1072 [See also IRMO  Wilson 
(2016)  4  Cal.App.5th  1011,  which  held  that  in  some  
circumstances  where  a  relative  of  the  obligor  cares  for  
the child and the obligor pays support to that person, the 
court    may    retain    equitable    discretion    to    deny    
enforcement of accrued arrears during that period].)  
1. Siblings 
The court may provide equitable credit for one child, 
without  providing  credit  for  a  sibling.  (See 
IRMO 
Okum 
(1987)  195  Cal.App.3d  176176 where  the  
Court  found  that  Father  had  full  custody  of    one 
child/sibling  and  paid  all  of  that  child’s  support,  
while  Mother  had  substantial  custody  of    the other 
child/sibling   and   had   incurred   expenses   while   
raising that child.)',

E. OVERPAYMENT CAUSED BY LUMP SUM 
PAYMENT OF DERIVATIVE BENEFITS 
2. Reconciliation 
Equitable  custody  credits  are  also  available  during  
periods of   reconciliation when both parties live in the 
same  home  with  the  child/children.  (Helgestad  v.  
Vargas (2014) 231 Cal.App.4
th
 719.)  
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  In  granting  an  equitable  credit, 
the   court   is   not   “equitably   forgiving   arrears,”   which 
would be an unlawful retroactive modification 
prohibited by FC  §  3651(c)(1)  and case law.  Instead, 
the  court  merely  finds  that  the  obligor  has  met  his/her  
court-ordered   obligation   due   to   having   custody;   the   
granting  of  the  credit  does  not  retroactively  modify  the  
court-ordered obligation. 
D. REFUND OF SUPPORT OVERPAYMENT 
A court has the discretion to decide whether an obligor 
is  entitled  to  reimbursement  for  overpayment  of  child  
support.   (
IRMO  Starr  (2010)   189   Cal.App.4
th
   277 
[where    the    parents    of    two    children    erroneously    
stipulated to child support calculated for four children, 
and obligor paid based on the amount for four children, 
the court had discretion to decline obligor’s request for 
reimbursement]; 
IRMO Peet (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 974 
[Credit  for  overpayments  lies  within  the  discretion  of  
the  court,  considering  primarily  whether  unfairness  or  
harm would befall the child(ren) if credit is given].)  
 
An   obligor   may   be   entitled   to   reimbursement   for   
overpayment  of  child  support  due  to  a  lump  sum  
payment   of   derivative   benefits.    In   a   case   of   first   
impression,   the   California   Court   of   Appeal,   Fourth   
District,  issued  a  published  decision  in  Y.H.  v  M.H  
(2018)  25  Cal.App.5
th 
300 (the  “Hanes  case,”)  affirming  
the  trial  court’s  order  granting  the  obligor  retroactive  
credit  for  a  lump-sum  payment  that  the  Social  Security  
Administration (SSA) disbursed to the obligee on behalf 
of     obligor’s     daughter,     which     resulted     in     an     
overpayment.  (Please  check  with  current  state  policy

benefit payments if this issue arises).',

At least one court has ruled that an agreement between 
parties  to  waive  unassigned  arrears  is  unenforceable  if  
there  is  no  dispute  as  to  the  amount  of  the  arrears  and  
the  amount  accepted  is  less  than  the  total  arrearages.  
(
FC  §  3651(c)(1)  and  3651(e); IRMO  Sabine  and  
Toshio  M. (2007)  153  Cal.App.4
th
  1203  [Where  arrears  
exceeded  $300,000 and  the  mother  agreed  to  accept 
$100,000   as   full   satisfaction   of   arrears,   the   court 
determined   a   waiver   of   arrears   is   not   enforceable   
without a bona fide dispute regarding the amount of   the 
arrears].“[A]n agreement for payment of   [only] a   part of 
the  amount  due  is  without  consideration.”  (Id.  at  1215  
[citations omitted]). 
 
 PRACTICE    POINT:    Some    LCSAs    believe    the 
holding in IRMO Sabine and Toshio M. was limited to 
the facts of the case and therefore continue to approve 
agreements to waive arrears. Because of the holding 
in IRMO Sabine and Toshio M., LCSAs may want to 
ask the court to hear testimony before approving an 
agreement to waive arrears. It is questionable whether 
the “Conditions of Waiver” (i.e., lump-sum payment, 
consistent sum-certain monthly arrears payment) 
constitute valid consideration. (See JCF FL-626, p. 3) 
G. INTEREST ON ARREARS  
Interest on arrears accrues at the legal rate of   10% as each 
payment is due. (
CCP § 685.010) (Prior to July 1, 1983, 
interest was 7%.) 
1. Effective  Date 
“[N]o   interest   shall   accrue   on   an   obligation   for   
current  child,  spousal,  family,  or  medical  support  
due  in  a  given  month  until  the  first  day  of  the  
following month.” (
FC § 17433.5) 
2. No Estoppel 
Accrual of   interest is not a discretionary matter but is 
instead  controlled  by  statute  and  continues  until  a  
judgment  is  satisfied.  (IRMO  McClellan (2005)  130  
Cal.App.4
th 
247.)  The  county  is  not  estopped  from

[The obligor could have calculated the interest on his 
own  and  it  was  not  the  county’s  burden  to  do  it  for  
him.] 
3. Installment  Judgment 
Only the initial support order shall be considered an 
installment  judgment;  no  order  setting  forth  the  
amount of   support owed for prior periods of time or 
establishing   periodic   payments   to   liquidate   the   
arrears shall be considered a   money judgment. (
FC 
§   155
,  as amended in 2002) 
4. Bankruptcy 
Interest  on  child  support  debt  (including  welfare  
arrears)   continues   to   accrue   after   a   Chapter   13   
petition   is   filed   and   is   non-dischargeable   and   
collectable,  even  after  discharge  and  even  if  not  
requested in the Plan or   Proof of   Claim. (
In re Foster 
(9th Cir. 2003) 319 F.3d 495). 
5. Military 
A servicemember may request a 6% interest rate on 
pre-service  debts  pursuant  to  the  Servicemember’s  
Civil  Relief  Act  (SCRA)  (See at 
50  USCA  § 3937.) 
(See also Section XV.C.7 –   Military). 
H. MOTION TO DETERMINE ARREARS  
Any  party  may  request  a  judicial  determination  of  
arrears.  (
FC  §  17526).  The  motion  shall   include   a   
monthly  breakdown  showing  amounts  ordered  and  
amounts paid. A court order determining arrears is res 
judicata  and  cannot  be  re-litigated  (as  to  that  time  
period).  (See

then to any interest, then to principal on arrears.

and  then  to  any  interest  due  on  that  past  due  
support. 
J. CHILD SUPPORT DEBT REDUCTION PROGRAM   
The  Child  Support  Debt  Reduction  Program  aligns  
eligibility  and  repayment  options  with  an  obligor’s  
ability  to  pay,  in  consideration  of  gross  income,  
family size and cost-of  -living for the county, state or 
territory  of  residence.  Cost  of  living  is  calculated  
using    collection    financial    standards    (allowable 
living  expenses)  as  published  annually  by  the  IRS. 
(
FC  §  17560.)  Information  regarding  this  program,  
forms, and resources, are available on the California 
Child Support Central. (See CSSI Letter 21- 04). This 
is an administrative program, which is not subject to 
the court’s jurisdiction.',

K. EFFECT  OF  RECONCILIATION  OR  MARRIAGE 
/ REMARRIAGE OF PARTIES ON THE ORDERS 
1. Orders  Nullified  During  Reconciliation 
A temporary support order is not enforceable during 
any period in which the parties have reconciled and 
are  living  together.  (
FC  §  3602).  For  permanent  
support orders, the obligor may seek equitable credit 
(under IRMO   Jackson) for   any   time   he   or   she   
reconciled  and  lived  with  the  other  parent  and  the  
children.     (Helgestad     v.     Vargas     (2014)     231     
Cal.App.4
th
  719 [Noting  the  obligor  has  the  burden  
of   proving they provided “in-kind” or   “in the home” 
support  for  the  children  while  living  in  the  home.  
This did not include rent paid by Father to Mother’s 
parents.   The  obligor  must  prove  the  support  was  
provided for the children]. 
2. Orders Terminated During     Marriage or 
Remarriage 
Remarriage  terminates  both  the  court’s  jurisdiction  
over  the  parties  and  the  support  orders  in  the  first  
divorce judgment. (Davis v. Davis (1968) 68 Cal.2d 
290.)  If  there  is  a  paternity  judgment  and  order  for  
support  prior  to  the  parties’  marriage,  the  act  of  
marriage   nullifies   the   child   support   provisions   
existing  prior  to  the  marriage.  (IRMO  Wilson  and  
Bodine (2012) 207 Cal.App.4
th
 768.) 
L. ESTOPPEL 
1. Estoppel  Against  a   Party 
Mere acquiescence in payment of   an amount of   child 
support less than that provided by a   final dissolution 
judgment  is  not  sufficient  to  constitute  a  waiver  or  
otherwise  to  bar  collection  of  the  unpaid  amounts.  
(IRMO Brinkman (2003) 111 Cal.App.4
th 
1281.) [The

2. Elements  of  Estoppel 
The  party  seeking  to  establish  estoppel  must  show  
by clear and convincing evidence that: 
(a) The party to be estopped knew the facts; 
(b) The other party was ignorant of   the true facts; 
(c)  The party intended [their] conduct would be 
acted upon, or acted in a manner that the party 
asserting the estoppel had a   right to believe it 
so intended; and 
(d)  The  other  party  relied  upon  the  conduct  to  
[their] injury. 
When one of the elements is missing, there can be 
no estoppel. (See IRMO Brinkman for a discussion 
of the elements of estoppel.) 
3. Estoppel  Against  the  County 
The   court   held   the   county   was   estopped   from   
collecting      the      child      support      arrears      as      
reimbursement for public assistance for foster care  
because  of  the  county’s  passive  failure  to  locate  the  
father and to provide the father with notice which  
resulted in the welfare payments. (County of Orange  
v. Carl D. (1999) 76 Cal.App.4
th
 429). 
M. FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT CUSTODY OR 
VISITATION RIGHTS AND CONCEALMENT 
Interference with visitation is not a   defense to  payment 
of    support.  “The existence or    enforcement of    a  duty  of  
support owed by a noncustodial parent for the support 
of a minor child is not affected by a failure or refusal by 
the  custodial  parent  to  implement  any  rights  as  to  
custody   or   visitation   granted   by   a   court   to   the   
noncustodial parent.” (
FC § 3556.) 
1. Interference  with  Visitation 
Mere      interference      with      visitation      without      
concealment of the child is not sufficient grounds to 
terminate a support obligation. (Cooper v. O’Rourke 
(1995) 32 Cal.App.4
th
 243). 
2. Concealment  of  Child 
Concealment   of   a   child   may   be   a   defense   to 
payment   of  support   if  all the  following  elements',

are met: 
a) The  children  were  actively  concealed  by  the  
obligee until the age of majority; 
b) The    obligor    was    reasonably    diligent    in    
attempting to locate the children; and

3. No   Defense   when   Concealment   Terminates   
During Child’s Minority 
The    defense    of    estoppel    is    not    available    if    
concealment  ends  while  the  children  are  minors.

hands. The court held that the family law court had 
broad  equitable  discretion  to  decline  to  enforce  the  
child support arrears. The court did not address

non-assigned   arrears   collections   become   a   debt   
owed to  the  estate  if  one  exists.  Under  Title  IV-D, 
continuing to collect on behalf of an estate is a non- 
IV-D  activity.   (See CSS  Letter  11-13.)   Assigned 
arrears will continue to be collected.

deceased). 
O.     INCARCERATED OBLIGORS  
1. Administrative  Suspension of Support –    
FC § 4700.5 
Any child support obligation that accrues on or after 
09/27/2022,  regardless  of  when  the  child  support  
order was established or last modified, is suspended 
by operation of law as of the first day of the first full 
month       of       incarceration       or       involuntary       
institutionalization      when      all      the      following      
conditions are met: 
• The    person    paying    support    has    been    
incarcerated  or  involuntarily  institutionalized  for  
more  than  ninety  consecutive  days  prior  to  the  
suspension. 
• To the extent known to the LCSA, the person 
paying  support  does  not  have  the  means  to  pay  
support     while     incarcerated     or     involuntarily     
institutionalized.   
Amended 
FC  §  4700.5  provides  that  if  the  person  
paying  support  is  released  on  or  after  01/01/2024,  
the  prior  child  support  obligation  resumes  on  the  
first  day  of  the  10th  month  after  the  release  from  
incarceration or institutionalization
. 
2. Exceptions 
• Incarceration/Involuntary  institutionalization  
includes,    but    is    not    limited    to,    involuntary

• Relief  is  not  available  if  the  person  paying  
support      has      the      means      to      pay      while      
incarcerated/involuntarily institutionalized. 
• The  prior  exception  that  excluded  relief  for

support  or  the  child,  or  failure  to  comply  with  a  
court order to pay support, are no longer excluded. 
These obligors now qualify for relief.

In   addition   to   affording   relief   under   its   own   
provisions,   the   current   version   of   
FC   §4007.5 
mandates  adjustment  of  child  support  obligations  
under some, but not all, prior versions of the statute, 
regardless    of    whether    the    prior    statute    was    
repealed.  If  the  person  paying  support  qualified  for  
an  administrative  or  court  ordered  adjustment  of  
the  support  order  under  a  former  version  of  
FC 
§4007.5

VIII. CONTEMPT AND  CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT  
A. CIVIL CONTEMPT VS. CRIMINAL CONTEMPT 
FC  §  290  provides  that  a  judgment  or  order  made  or  
entered  pursuant  to  the  Family  Code  may  be  enforced  
by the court through contempt proceedings. 
FC § 4500 
allows that a   support order made, entered or enforceable 
in this state is enforceable, whether or not the order was 
made or entered pursuant to the Family Code. 
Contempt actions can be filed pursuant to 
CCP § 1209, 
CCP § 1209.5 or PC § 166(a)(4). Filing under the CCP 
allows the matter to be heard in the IV-D Court, usually 
by the same Commissioner that hears the regular IV-D 
calendar. However, filing under the Penal Code requires 
the  case  to  be  heard  as  a  criminal  proceeding  and  can  
only  be  done  by  the  local  district  attorney’s  office  or  
specially deputized child support attorneys.

under  the  penal  code  is  criminal.  For  purposes  of  this  
sourcebook   the   two   civil   contempt   options   will   be   
labeled  “civil  coercive”  and  “civil  punitive”.  In  LCSA  
contempt cases, the process is  punitive but has a coercive 
goal.    The    punitive    process,    as    defined,    has    a    
determinative      sentence      as      compared      to      an      
indeterminate  penalty  that  will  exist  until  a  wrong  is  
cured. 
In practice, when there is a possibility that a guilty citee 
will be sentenced to jail time, that citee must be afforded 
criminal due process protections. (Hicks v. Feiock (1988) 
485  U.S.  624;  County  of  Santa  Clara  v.  Super.  Ct.  
(Rodriguez) (1992) 2 Cal. App. 4th 1686). 
 NOTE: The JCF  FL-410 (OSC  and  Affidavit  for  
Contempt)    states    that    a    contempt    proceeding    is    
“criminal in nature.” 
B. CIVIL CONTEMPT 
CCP §   1209 AND CCP §   1209.5 
1. Different  Statutes 
CCP § 1209 may be used for violations of any court 
order, such as failure to perform a   job search. 
CCP § 
1209.5 
may  only  be  used  for  failure  to  pay  child  
support and family support. 
2. Statute of  Limitations 
Pursuant   to   
CCP   §   1218.5(b),   the   period   of   
limitations to commence a   contempt action for failure 
to pay child, family or spousal support is three years 
from  the  date  that  the  payment  was  due.  For  other  
orders falling within the Family Code, the period of 
limitations is two years from the date that the alleged 
contempt occurred. 
3. Standing 
The  LCSA  lacks  standing  to  file  contempt  in  a  non- 
aid case unless there has been a request for services 
from a non-aid parent. (Codoni v. Codoni (2002) 103

4. CCP §   1209.5 Elements 
a. The three requirements are: 
1) a   lawful support order; 
2) knowledge of   the order; and 
3)  failure  to  comply  with  the  order.  (IRMO 
Sachs (2002)     95     Cal.App.4
th
 1144). 
Proving  these  requirements  is  prima  facie  
evidence of contempt of court. 
b. Lawful Order 
A court of   competent jurisdiction made an order 
compelling a parent to furnish support. 
1) The order must be in writing, clear, specific 
and  unequivocal.  (In  re  Marcus (2006)  138  
Cal.App.4
th
 1009). 
2) Can be proven by judicial notice of records 
in court file. (
EC § 452 and EC § 453). 
c. Knowledge 
This element can be established by proof that the 
order was served on the citee or   that the citee was 
present in court when the order was made. If the 
citee   was   not   present   in   court   or   served,   
knowledge can be demonstrated by: 
1) Inference (In re Ivey (2000) 85 Cal.App.4
th
 
793 [knowledge  of  the  order  by  the  attorney  
representing the citee may create a   permissive 
inference that the citee had knowledge of the 
order]); or 
2) Evidence  such  as  prior  payments,  contact  
with     the     LCSA     regarding     the     order,     
enforcement of   the order, discussions with the 
other party, etc. 
d. Non-Compliance 
The citee did not comply with the order. 
1) May  use  EC  §  1280  (record  by  public  
employee)   to   have   the   financial   records   
admitted  without  the  need  for  testimony.

Services (2005) 133 Cal.App.4
th

2) The CP may testify about payments missed 
during  months  that  the  order  was  payable  
directly  to  CP  and  should  be  available  to  
rebut any evidence that the obligor paid the 
CP directly. 
3) A   child   support   representative   may   be   
called  to  testify  about  payments  missed  or  
regarding  the  mode  of  preparation  of  child  
support records. (
EC § 1271). 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  If  the  NCP’s  only  argument  is 
lack  of  ability  to  pay  the  support  order,  request  that  the  
NCP/attorney    stipulate    to    the    other    prima    facie 
elements. 
5. CCP §   1209 Elements 
a. The four requirements are: 
1) a   lawful order (discussed above); 
2) knowledge of   the order (discussed above); 
3) ability to comply; and 
4) willful disobedience. (In re Ivey, supra, 85 
Cal.App.4
th
 793). 
b. Ability to  Comply 
For 
CCP §   1209, ability to comply with the order 
is   an   element   that   must   be   proven   by   the   
petitioner   (DCSS).   Additionally,   for   
CCP   §   
1209.5, if the failure to pay support occurs many 
years after the support order is entered, ability to 
comply may become an element of   the contempt. 
(
Mery  v.  Superior  Court (1937)  9    Cal.2d  379, 
380-381; In re Ivey, supra, 85 Cal.App.4

 793). 
 NOTE: For 
CCP §   1209.5,  inability to comply 
is  an  affirmative  defense  that  must  be  raised  by  
the citee. It is not a required element for a prima 
facie  case.  (See C.1  infra,  for  further information 
about   the   affirmative   defense   of   inability   to   
comply). 
c. Willful Disobedience

is  inexcusable.  (Little  v.  Superior  Court (1968) 
260   Cal.App.2d   311).   Willfulness   does   not   
require a bad intent but only that the citee knew 
what he was doing as a   free agent. Reliance upon 
advice   of   counsel   is   not   a   defense   to   the   
willfulness of   the conduct. (In re Bongfeldt (1971) 
22 Cal.App.3d 465, 476).

3) 3rd or any subsequent conviction 
Up  to  240  hours  jail  and  up  to  240  hours  
community service for each count. 
4) Alternate  to  incarceration  and  probation  
timeframes 
In    lieu    of    an    order    of    imprisonment,    
community  service,  or  both,  as  set  forth  in  
paragraph (1), the court may grant probation 
or a conditional sentence for a period not to 
exceed   one   year   upon   a   first   finding   of   
contempt,  a  period  not  to  exceed  two  years  
upon  a  second  finding  of  contempt,  and  a  
period not to exceed three years upon a   third 
or any subsequent finding of contempt. 
C. PROBATION CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS 
Changes to existing law authorizes courts that were not 
already utilizing probation to now do so. Standard terms 
and   conditions   of   probation   may   include:   seek   or 
maintain  full-time  employment;  pay  the  court  ordered  
support  or  arrears  payment  each  month;  attend  each',

court hearing; and obey all laws. 
1. If  the  citee  fails  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  
probation, the court may revoke the probation and 
execute    the    sentence    following    a    probation    
revocation  hearing.  Some  courts  follow  the  Penal  
Code   sections   regarding   probation   revocation,   
even though the sections do not specifically apply 
to civil contempt proceedings. (i.e. 
PC § 1203.2(a) 
[revocation  of  probation  tolls  the  running  of  the  
probationary period]). 
2. Many  courts  have  decided  to  apply  the  limits  
retroactively citing (In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 
740 (Estrada)), Estrada stands for the principle that 
when  the  Legislature  amends  a  statute  so  as  to  
lessen  a  penalty,  the  former  penalty  must  have  
been too severe. 
 NOTE: The  time  limitation  of  one  year  may  
encourage  an  LCSA  to  conduct  more  frequent  
review hearings to ensure compliance. It  is at these 
review  hearings  where  an  LCSA  attorney  would  
request a  probation revocation hearing if  the terms 
of the probation are not being met. 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Remember  that  if  an  ordered  
probation  term  is  less  than  the  court-ordered  support  
obligation,  you  should  expressly  state  that  fact  in  the  
Findings   and   Order. Additionally,   the   order   should   
emphasize   that   this   term   in   no   way   modifies   the   
underlying support obligation. 
1. Other Requests 
There is some authority that once a citee is adjudged 
guilty  of    contempt,  the  court   shall  not   entertain 
further  requests   (e.g.   motion   to  modify   support) 
filed  by  the  citee,  until  the  underlying  contempt  is  
purged.   (Schubert   v.   Superior   Court (1930)   109   
Cal.App. 633). 
 NOTE: However, given  the  law’s  preference  for  
accurate  orders  and  recognition  that  the  citee/NCP  
may   be   in   contempt   because   the order actually 
needed   to   be   modified,   this   position   may   be   
untenable.',

2. Amended Affidavit 
In  a contempt  action  the  charging  affidavit  must 
allege the evidentiary facts of a prima facie case with 
specificity. JCF  FL-410 and JCF  FL-411.  However,  
the  affidavit or   statement in support of   the contempt 
action  may  be  amended  at  any  time  during  the  
proceedings,  unless  substantial  rights  of  the  citee  
would  be  prejudiced,  in  which  event  a    reasonable 
postponement may be granted. (
CCP § 1211.5(b)). 
3. Jury trial 
a. The  citee  is  not  entitled  to  a  jury  trial  unless  
there is a potential to be sentenced to more than 
180  days  in  jail.  If  tried  without  a  jury  and  the  
citee does not expressly waive the right to a   jury, 
the court may only impose a maximum sentence 
of    180  days.    (In  re  Kreitman (1995)  40 
Cal.App.4
th
 750, 753-755). 
b. The right  to  a   jury  trial  is  constitutional.  (PC 
§ 689; CA Const. Art. 1, sec. 16). 
 NOTE: Under the U.S. Constitution, the right 
to  a  jury  trial  applies  to  crimes  that  carry  a  
sentence of more than 6 months. 
 PRACTICE POINT:  To  avoid  the  need  for  a  jury  trial,  
keep the maximum  counts  alleged  on  a  first  contempt 
at 35, which could result in a 175-day sentence. 
4. Right to Counsel 
In  civil contempt actions, California Courts have long 
offered appointment of   public defenders or the right 
to  retain  private  counsel  for  representation  of  the  
citee  where  potential  punishment  is  deprivation  of  
liberty  i.e.  incarceration.  (GC § 27706(a), County  of 
Santa  Clara  v.  Super.  Ct.  (Rodriguez),  supra, 2  Cal.  
App. 4th 1686, 1693). 
5. The Final Rule –   Guidelines to Follow Pursuant 
to 
45 CFR § 303.6(c)(4) 
The OCSS issued   the   Final   Rule   on   Flexibility,   
Efficiency,    and    Modernization    in    Child    Support    
Enforcement Programs (the Final Rule) in 2016. 81 F.R.',

93562 (2016).  A  portion  of  the  Final  Rule  amended  
criteria  and  procedures  for  child  support  contempt  
proceedings  to  ensure  that  they  comply  with  the  
constitutional   principles   articulated   in   Turner   v.   
Rogers et al.,  564 U.S. 431 (2011).  The Supreme Court 
in Turner (a case originating in South Carolina) held 
that  an  obligor  was  entitled  to  Court  appointed  
counsel in the context of a civil contempt unless the 
opposing  party  was  unrepresented  and  the  Court  
provided alternative procedural safeguards ensuring 
that the proceedings were fundamentally fair. 
The Final Rule at 45 CFR §303.6(c) (4) (2017) imposed 
three  requirements  on  IV-D  agencies  in  regard  to  
civil contempt procedure: 
a. Screen  the  case  for  information  regarding  the  
obligor’s ability to pay or otherwise comply with 
the order.  This relates to how recently the order 
was  made,  the  financial  information  considered  
in   making   the   order,   and   ensures   that   the   
contempt  process  is  not  used  mechanically  but  
rather   as   a   last   resort   for   enforcement.   (A   
convenient  check  list  is  included  in  the  state’s  
policy and procedural manual.) 
b. Provide  the  Court  with  available  information  
regarding the obligor’s ability to comply with the 
order  which  may  assist  the  Court  in  making  a  
factual  determination  of  the  obligor’s  ability  to  
pay  the  purge  amount  (civil  coercive  contempt)  
or    probationary    conditions    (civil    punitive    
contempt). 
 NOTE:  In  a  finding  of  guilt  or  taking  of  a  
guilty plea, the court should state that there is a 
factual  basis  for  that  finding.  (See JCF  FL-415, 
part 5.e.). 
 NOTE:   A   civil   coercive   contempt   action   
requires  the  contemnor  to  perform  an  act,  i.e.  a  
conditional  or  indeterminate  sentence  (the  citee  
holds  the  keys  to  his  own  jail  cell).  A  civil  
punitive contempt punishes for non-compliance',

of an ordered act i.e. a determinate sentence. 
 NOTE: Most   California   IV-D   contempt   
actions are civil punitive actions where the issue 
is  whether  the  citee  had  the  ability  to  pay  the  
ordered support at the time that it was due, not 
at  the  time  of  the  contempt  hearing.  Therefore, 
the purge amount is not technically relevant. 
c. Provide  clear  notice  to  the  obligor  that  their  
ability  to  pay  constitutes  the  critical  question  in  
the  civil  contempt  action.  Until  JC  forms  have  
been  modified,  this  requirement  can  be  met  by  
attaching    the    “Civil    Contempt    Proceedings    
Cover Letter” form DCSS 0755. 
6. Bankruptcy 
Generally,  the  filing  of  a  bankruptcy  petition  stays  
any type of   action against the debtor (automatic stay). 
Criminal  actions  are  not  stayed  because  they  are  
punitive in nature. (
11 USC § 362(b)(1)). 
 
 PRACTICE POINT: 292 B.R. 645). Where the 
contempt  is  strictly  to  enforce  or  coerce  payment  of  a  
debt,  the  proceeding  has  been  found to  be prohibited 
by the stay. (In re Stovall (1990, Bankr. N.D. Ga.) 126 
B.R.   814).   As   such,   case   law   suggests   that   civil 
contempt   proceedings   seeking   only   to   punish   (as   
opposed  to  coerce  payment)  are  not  barred  from  the  
automatic    stay.    However,    based on the varying 
opinions   of   courts   and the broad authority   of   the 
Federal  Court  to  issue  sanctions  for  a  violation  of  the  
automatic  stay,  (see,  e.g.,  In  re  Springer (2017  W.D. 
Ky.)  2017 WL  3575  859),  a  civil  contempt  should not 
be filed while an automatic stay is in place. 
 NOTE: Federal  Courts  have  exclusive  and  final  
authority  in  deciding  the  scope  and  application  of  the  
automatic stay. (In re Gruntz (2000) 202 F.3d 1074 [here, 
the  court  also  found  that  the  automatic  stay  did  not  
apply   to   preclude   state   court   criminal   proceedings   
against a debtor for failing to pay child support]). 
7. Appeal 
A finding  of  contempt  by  a  court  of  competent  
jurisdiction  may  not  be  appealed.  (
CCP  §  904.1)',

Instead, the contemnor’s only option is to file a writ 
of certiorari or writ of habeas corpus in the Court of 
Appeal.  (Devine  v.  Devine  (1963)  213  Cal.App.2d  
549). 
D. DEFENSES TO CIVIL CONTEMPT  
1. Inability  to   Comply 
For  a  contempt  filed  pursuant  to  
CCP  §  1209.5, 
ability to comply is  not an element of the prima facie 
case but is an affirmative defense to be proven by a 
preponderance  of  the  evidence.  (Moss  v.  Superior 
Court (1998) 17 Cal.4
th
 396).  
a. Burden of Proof 
Because  the  court  determined  the  citee’s  ability  to  
pay the underlying order by calculating his or her 
income when support was set, if the act of alleged 
contempt  is  committed  close  to  the  time  the  court  
issued  the underlying  order,  then  inability  to  pay 
is an affirmative defense, to be proven by the citee. 
(In  re  McCarty (1908)  154  Cal.  534,  537-538; In  re 
Ivey, supra, 85 Cal.App.4
th
 793, 798-799). However, 
the petitioner (DCSS) may have to prove ability to 
pay  if  the  citee’s  disobedience  of  the  court’s  order  
occurred  a long  time  after  the  court  issued  its 
order. (Mery v. Superior Court, supra,  9   Cal.2d 379, 
380-381 [ability  to  pay  must  be  proven  when  10  
years  elapsed  between  the  support  order  and  the  
contempt allegation]). 
b. Unemployment 
A   citee can   be   found   in   contempt   when   the 
inability to pay is “the result of the parent’s willful 
failure  to  seek  and  accept  available  employment  
that  is  commensurate  with  his  or  her  skills  and  
ability.”  (Moss v.  Superior  Court,  supra, 17 Cal.4
th
 
396, 401). 
c. Partial Payments 
Even  if  the  court  finds  the  party  did  not  have  the  
ability to pay the full amount ordered, a contempt 
adjudication   can   be   based   on   failure   to   make',

  184
);

partial  payments.  However,  the  citee  must  show 
compliance  with  the  order  to  the  fullest  extent  of  
his/her  ability.  (Lyon  v.  Superior  Court  (1968)  68  
Cal.2d 446). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  If  the  citee  admits  he/she  has  
paid  his/her  other  bills  instead  of  the  child  support  
obligation,   refer   to FC   § 4011 (payment   of   child 
support  shall  be  made  before  payment  of  any  debts  
owed  to  creditors)  or  if  the  evidence  shows  the  obligor  
took  vacations  or  purchased  expensive  items,  refer  to  
FC  §    4053 (a  parent’s  first  and  principal  obligation is 
to support his or her minor children). 
d. Evidence of Inability to  Comply 
While  not  exhaustive,  the  following  list  includes  
evidence  that  may  be  used  to  prove  inability  to  
pay.  Generally,  a  contempt  allegation  should  not  
be  filed  when  the  obligor  was  receiving  need-
based  public  assistance,  has  a  disability,  or  was  
incarcerated  during  the  contempt  period  and  had  
no other income. 
1) Need-Based Public Assistance 
Receipt of need-based public assistance (i.e. SSI, 
SSP, General Assistance, CalWORKs) supports a 
citee’s  argument  of  inability  to  comply  with  the  
order  because  the  agency  providing  the  public  
assistance  is  presumed  to  have  evaluated  the  
obligor’s   income   and   ability   to   earn   before   
granting the aid. 
2) Disability 
Proof  that  the  obligor  had  a  disability  and  was  
unable   to   work   during   the   contempt   period   
supports   this   defense.   In   asserting   that   a   
disability prevented the obligor from complying 
with   the   order,   the   obligor   should   provide   
detailed  records  from  a  physician  stating  the  
disability  and  that  it  prevented  him/her  from  
working.   However,   if   the   obligor   had   other   
income   (ex:   veterans’   disability   benefits),   the   
disability does not excuse the failure to pay.',

3) Incarceration 
Incarceration  during  the  contempt  period  is  a  
defense if the incarcerated obligor does not have 
actual  income  (i.e.  trust,  investment,  real  estate  
income)  or  the  opportunity  to  work  to  earn  
income. (See Section IV – Support). 
 
 PRACTICE   POINT:   If   the   citee   claims   mental   
incompetence,   some courts   use the   procedure set 
forth  in  PC  §  1369  to  determine  whether  the  citee  is 
able  to  understand  the  nature  of  the  proceedings  and  
assist in their defense. 
2. Employer Contempt 
If  an  employer  withholds  support  as  required  by  
wage  assignment,  the  obligor  shall  not  be  held  in  
contempt  for  nonpayment  of  the  support  that  was  
withheld  by  the  employer  but  not  received  by  the  
obligee. (
FC §   5241(b) The employer though may be 
charged with contempt and brought to court. 
E. CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT  
Child  support  obligations  may  be  enforced  under  the  
Penal  Code  by  filing  for  criminal  contempt  (PC  §  
166(a)(4),  criminal non-support (PC §  270), or   criminal 
abandonment  (
PC  §  271).  Prior  to  filing  a  criminal  
action, or at least prior to the first hearing, always review 
the  California  Jury  Instructions  related  to  the  action.  
Note  that  LCSA  attorneys  must  either  be  deputized to 
file criminal actions or refer the case to the local district 
attorney for prosecution.

Constitution    guarantees    a    jury    trial    in    all

a. Elements of the Crime 
1) The  defendant  is  the  parent  of  the  minor  
child; 
2) The defendant has failed to furnish necessary 
clothing,  food,  shelter,  medical  attendance  or  
other remedial care; and, 
3) The omission was willful and without lawful 
excuse. 
b. Parentage 
Evidence  of  parentage  is  the  same  as  in  a  civil  
action.  (
PC  §  270).  However,  a  prior  guilty  plea  
under 
PC §   270 is not conclusive on the parentage 
issue. (
People v. Camp (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 651) 
If parentage is truly at issue, attempt to establish 
parentage prior to initiating a criminal action. 
c. Failure to Provide 
Failure to provide is based on defendant’s ability 
(i.e.   income,   work   skills,   abilities).   (People   v.

a   child is prima facie evidence of   willfulness. (PC 
§   270).   This   shifts   the   burden   of   producing

e. Affirmative Defense 
Failure to provide support may be excused when 
the omission was due to no fault of   the defendant

income).  (People  v.  Cressey  (1970)  2  Cal.3d  836,

People v. Sorensen (1968) 68 Cal.2d 280). 
f. Penalties 
The penalty for a misdemeanor is up to one year 
in  county  jail  and/or  up  to  a  $2,000  fine.  The  
penalty for a felony is up to one year and one day 
in state  prison  and/or  up  to  a  $2,000  fine.  (
PC  §  
270
). 
g. Statute of Limitations 
If  charged  as  a  misdemeanor,  action  must  be  
commenced within one year after commission of 
the offense. (
PC § 802) If charged as a felony, the 
action  must  be  commenced  within  three  years  
after commission of the offense. (
PC § 801). 
h. Felony 
To  charge  a  
PC § 270 as  a  felony,  the  defendant  
must have a   prior 
PC §   270 conviction. (People v. 
Gregori (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 353).

b. Crime 
Willful  failure  to  pay  a  support  obligation  for  a  
child who resides in another state (for over 1 year 
or  more  than  $5,000)  or  travel  in  interstate  or  
foreign  commerce  with  the  intent  to  evade  a  
support obligation. (
18 USC § 228(a)). 
 NOTE: Under 
18 USC § 228(b), the existence 
of  a  support  obligation  that  was  in  effect  for  the  
time    period    charged    in    the    indictment    or    
information creates a rebuttable presumption that 
the  obligor  has  the  ability  to  pay  the  support  
obligation  for  that  time  period.  This  was  held  
unconstitutional by U.S. v. Pillor (2005 N.D. Ca.) 
387 F.Supp.2d 1053. The Court in Pillor found that 
because 
18 USC §   228(b) contained a mandatory 
rebuttable presumption that an obligor who failed 
to pay support obligations had the ability to do so, 
that  section  violates  due  process  by  relieving  the  
government of   the burden of establishing that the 
alleged  offense  was  willful.  The  Court  in Pillor, 
however, found the unconstitutional presumption',

A. CREATING THE LIEN 
1. Methods  of Creation 
Pursuant to 
CCP § 697.320,  a judgment lien against 
real property interests of   a support obligor is created 
by recording with the county recorder: 
d. An abstract of   judgment (JCF FL-480 ); 
e. A Notice of   Support Judgment (DCSS 0239); 
f. A certified copy of   a   support judgment; or   
g. A federal Notice of   Lien (OMB 0970-0152). 
 
 PRACTICE  POINT:  Due  to  its  ease  of  use,  the 
Notice  of  Support  Judgment  is  the  preferred method 
for   LCSAs   to   create   a   lien   against   real   property 
because  it  can  be  recorded  directly  with  the  county  
recorder   without   certification   by   a   court   clerk.   The 
Notice  of  Support  Judgment  has  the  same  force  and  
effect  as  an abstract  of  judgment.  (FC  §    4506(c)). 
2. Satisfaction  or  Release Necessary 
A  recorded  judgment  lien  for  support  continues
